Subject: [PATCH 2/3] sgl_alloc_order: fix memory leak

[ Upstream commit b2a182a40278bc5849730e66bca01a762188ed86 ]

sgl_alloc_order() can fail when 'length' is large on a memory
constrained system. When order > 0 it will potentially be
making several multi-page allocations with the later ones more
likely to fail than the earlier one. So it is important that
sgl_alloc_order() frees up any pages it has obtained before
returning NULL. In the case when order > 0 it calls the wrong
free page function and leaks. In testing the leak was
sufficient to bring down my 8 GiB laptop with OOM.
