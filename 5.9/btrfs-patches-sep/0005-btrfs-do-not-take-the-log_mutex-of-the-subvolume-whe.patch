Subject: [PATCH 05/10] btrfs: do not take the log_mutex of the subvolume when
 pinning the log

During a rename we pin the log to make sure no one commits a log that
reflects an ongoing rename operation, as it might result in a committed
log where it recorded the unlink of the old name without having recorded
the new name. However we are taking the subvolume's log_mutex before
incrementing the log_writers counter, which is not necessary since that
counter is atomic and we only remove the old name from the log and add
the new name to the log after we have incremented log_writers, ensuring
that no one can commit the log after we have removed the old name from
the log and before we added the new name to the log.

By taking the log_mutex lock we are just adding unnecessary contention on
the lock, which can become visible for workloads that mix renames with
fsyncs, writes for files opened with O_SYNC and unlink operations (if the
inode or its parent were fsynced before in the current transaction).

So just remove the lock and unlock of the subvolume's log_mutex at
btrfs_pin_log_trans().

Using dbench, which mixes different types of operations that end up taking
that mutex (fsyncs, renames, unlinks and writes into files opened with
O_SYNC) revealed some small gains. The following script that calls dbench
was used:

  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/nvme0n1
  MNT=/mnt/btrfs
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o ssd -o space_cache=v2"
  MKFS_OPTIONS="-m single -d single"
  THREADS=32

  echo "performance" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
  mkfs.btrfs -f $MKFS_OPTIONS $DEV
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

  dbench -s -t 600 -D $MNT $THREADS

  umount $MNT

The test was run on bare metal, no virtualization, on a box with 12 cores
(Intel i7-8700), 64Gb of RAM and using a NVMe device, with a kernel
configuration that is the default of typical distributions (debian in this
case), without debug options enabled (kasan, kmemleak, slub debug, debug
of page allocations, lock debugging, etc).
