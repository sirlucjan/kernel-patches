Subject: [PATCH 2/9] lib: zstd: Add decompress_sources.h for decompress_unzstd

Adds decompress_sources.h which includes every .c file necessary for
zstd decompression. This is used in decompress_unzstd.c so the internal
structure of the library isn't exposed.

This allows us to upgrade the zstd library version without modifying any
callers. Instead we just need to update decompress_sources.h.
