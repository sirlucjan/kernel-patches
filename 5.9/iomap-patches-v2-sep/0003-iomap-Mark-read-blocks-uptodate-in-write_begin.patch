Subject: [PATCH 3/4] iomap: Mark read blocks uptodate in write_begin

When bringing (portions of) a page uptodate, we were marking blocks that
were zeroed as being uptodate, but not blocks that were read from storage.

Like the previous commit, this problem was found with generic/127 and
a kernel which failed readahead I/Os.  This bug causes writes to be
silently lost when working with flaky storage.

Fixes: 9dc55f1389f9 ("iomap: add support for sub-pagesize buffered I/O without buffer heads")
