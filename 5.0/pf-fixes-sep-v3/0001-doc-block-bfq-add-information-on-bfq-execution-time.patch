Subject: [PATCH 1/2] doc, block, bfq: add information on bfq execution time

The execution time of BFQ has been slightly lowered. Report the new
execution time in BFQ documentation.

+As every I/O scheduler, BFQ adds some overhead to per-I/O-request
+processing. To give an idea of this overhead, the total,
+single-lock-protected, per-request processing time of BFQ---i.e., the
+sum of the execution times of the request insertion, dispatch and
+completion hooks---is, e.g., 1.9 us on an Intel Core i7-2760QM@2.40GHz
+(dated CPU for notebooks; time measured with simple code
+instrumentation, and using the throughput-sync.sh script of the S
+suite [1], in performance-profiling mode). To put this result into
+context, the total, single-lock-protected, per-request execution time
+of the lightest I/O scheduler available in blk-mq, mq-deadline, is 0.7
+us (mq-deadline is ~800 LOC, against ~10500 LOC for BFQ).
