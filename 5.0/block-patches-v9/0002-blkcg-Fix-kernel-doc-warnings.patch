Subject: [PATCH 2/4] blkcg: Fix kernel-doc warnings

Avoid that the following warnings are reported when building with W=1:

block/blk-cgroup.c:1755: warning: Function parameter or member 'q'
not described in 'blkcg_schedule_throttle'
block/blk-cgroup.c:1755: warning: Function parameter or member
'use_memdelay' not described in 'blkcg_schedule_throttle'
block/blk-cgroup.c:1779: warning: Function parameter or member 'blkg'
not described in 'blkcg_add_delay'
block/blk-cgroup.c:1779: warning: Function parameter or member 'now'
not described in 'blkcg_add_delay'
block/blk-cgroup.c:1779: warning: Function parameter or member
'delta' not described in 'blkcg_add_delay'
