Subject: [PATCH 09/15] block, bfq: unconditionally plug I/O in asymmetric
 scenarios

bfq detects the creation of multiple bfq_queues shortly after each
other, namely a burst of queue creations in the terminology used in
the code. If the burst is large, then no queue in the burst is granted
- either I/O-dispatch plugging when the queue remains temporarily
  idle while in service;
- or weight raising, because it causes even longer plugging.

In fact, such a plugging tends to lower throughput, while these bursts
are typically due to applications or services that spawn multiple
processes, to reach a common goal as soon as possible. Examples are a
"git grep" or the booting of a system.

Unfortunately, disabling plugging may cause a loss of service
guarantees in asymmetric scenarios, i.e., if queue weights are
differentiated or if more than one group is active.

This commit addresses this issue by no longer disabling I/O-dispatch
plugging for queues in large bursts.

+ * There is a case where idling must be performed not for
+ * throughput concerns, but to preserve service guarantees.
+ *
+ * To introduce this case, we can note that allowing the drive
+ * to enqueue more than one request at a time, and hence
+ * delegating de facto final scheduling decisions to the
+ * drive's internal scheduler, entails loss of control on the
+ * actual request service order. In particular, the critical
+ * situation is when requests from different processes happen
+ * to be present, at the same time, in the internal queue(s)
+ * of the drive. In such a situation, the drive, by deciding
+ * the service order of the internally-queued requests, does
+ * determine also the actual throughput distribution among
+ * these processes. But the drive typically has no notion or
+ * concern about per-process throughput distribution, and
+ * makes its decisions only on a per-request basis. Therefore,
+ * the service distribution enforced by the drive's internal
+ * scheduler is likely to coincide with the desired
+ * device-throughput distribution only in a completely
+ * symmetric scenario where:
+ * (i)  each of these processes must get the same throughput as
+ *      the others;
+ * (ii) the I/O of each process has the same properties, in
+ *      terms of locality (sequential or random), direction
+ *      (reads or writes), request sizes, greediness
+ *      (from I/O-bound to sporadic), and so on.
+ * In fact, in such a scenario, the drive tends to treat
+ * the requests of each of these processes in about the same
+ * way as the requests of the others, and thus to provide
+ * each of these processes with about the same throughput
+ * (which is exactly the desired throughput distribution). In
+ * contrast, in any asymmetric scenario, device idling is
+ * certainly needed to guarantee that bfqq receives its
+ * assigned fraction of the device throughput (see [1] for
+ * details).
+ * The problem is that idling may significantly reduce
+ * throughput with certain combinations of types of I/O and
+ * devices. An important example is sync random I/O, on flash
+ * storage with command queueing. So, unless bfqq falls in the
+ * above cases where idling also boosts throughput, it would
+ * be important to check conditions (i) and (ii) accurately,
+ * so as to avoid idling when not strictly needed for service
+ * guarantees.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to thoroughly
+ * check condition (ii). And, in case there are active groups,
+ * it becomes very difficult to check condition (i) too. In
+ * fact, if there are active groups, then, for condition (i)
+ * to become false, it is enough that an active group contains
+ * more active processes or sub-groups than some other active
+ * group. More precisely, for condition (i) to hold because of
+ * such a group, it is not even necessary that the group is
+ * (still) active: it is sufficient that, even if the group
+ * has become inactive, some of its descendant processes still
+ * have some request already dispatched but still waiting for
+ * completion. In fact, requests have still to be guaranteed
+ * their share of the throughput even after being
+ * dispatched. In this respect, it is easy to show that, if a
+ * group frequently becomes inactive while still having
+ * in-flight requests, and if, when this happens, the group is
+ * not considered in the calculation of whether the scenario
+ * is asymmetric, then the group may fail to be guaranteed its
+ * fair share of the throughput (basically because idling may
+ * not be performed for the descendant processes of the group,
+ * but it had to be).  We address this issue with the
+ * following bi-modal behavior, implemented in the function
+ * bfq_symmetric_scenario().
+ *
+ * If there are groups with requests waiting for completion
+ * (as commented above, some of these groups may even be
+ * already inactive), then the scenario is tagged as
+ * asymmetric, conservatively, without checking any of the
+ * conditions (i) and (ii). So the device is idled for bfqq.
+ * This behavior matches also the fact that groups are created
+ * exactly if controlling I/O is a primary concern (to
+ * preserve bandwidth and latency guarantees).
+ *
+ * On the opposite end, if there are no groups with requests
+ * waiting for completion, then only condition (i) is actually
+ * controlled, i.e., provided that condition (i) holds, idling
+ * is not performed, regardless of whether condition (ii)
+ * holds. In other words, only if condition (i) does not hold,
+ * then idling is allowed, and the device tends to be
+ * prevented from queueing many requests, possibly of several
+ * processes. Since there are no groups with requests waiting
+ * for completion, then, to control condition (i) it is enough
+ * to check just whether all the queues with requests waiting
+ * for completion also have the same weight.
+ *
+ * Not checking condition (ii) evidently exposes bfqq to the
+ * risk of getting less throughput than its fair share.
+ * However, for queues with the same weight, a further
+ * mechanism, preemption, mitigates or even eliminates this
+ * problem. And it does so without consequences on overall
+ * throughput. This mechanism and its benefits are explained
+ * in the next three paragraphs.
+ *
+ * Even if a queue, say Q, is expired when it remains idle, Q
+ * can still preempt the new in-service queue if the next
+ * request of Q arrives soon (see the comments on
+ * bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation). If all queues and
+ * groups have the same weight, this form of preemption,
+ * combined with the hole-recovery heuristic described in the
+ * comments on function bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation,
+ * are enough to preserve a correct bandwidth distribution in
+ * the mid term, even without idling. In fact, even if not
+ * idling allows the internal queues of the device to contain
+ * many requests, and thus to reorder requests, we can rather
+ * safely assume that the internal scheduler still preserves a
+ * minimum of mid-term fairness.
+ *
+ * More precisely, this preemption-based, idleless approach
+ * provides fairness in terms of IOPS, and not sectors per
+ * second. This can be seen with a simple example. Suppose
+ * that there are two queues with the same weight, but that
+ * the first queue receives requests of 8 sectors, while the
+ * second queue receives requests of 1024 sectors. In
+ * addition, suppose that each of the two queues contains at
+ * most one request at a time, which implies that each queue
+ * always remains idle after it is served. Finally, after
+ * remaining idle, each queue receives very quickly a new
+ * request. It follows that the two queues are served
+ * alternatively, preempting each other if needed. This
+ * implies that, although both queues have the same weight,
+ * the queue with large requests receives a service that is
+ * 1024/8 times as high as the service received by the other
+ * queue.
+ *
+ * The motivation for using preemption instead of idling (for
+ * queues with the same weight) is that, by not idling,
+ * service guarantees are preserved (completely or at least in
+ * part) without minimally sacrificing throughput. And, if
+ * there is no active group, then the primary expectation for
+ * this device is probably a high throughput.
+ *
+ * We are now left only with explaining the additional
+ * compound condition that is checked below for deciding
+ * whether the scenario is asymmetric. To explain this
+ * compound condition, we need to add that the function
+ * bfq_symmetric_scenario checks the weights of only
+ * non-weight-raised queues, for efficiency reasons (see
+ * comments on bfq_weights_tree_add()). Then the fact that
+ * bfqq is weight-raised is checked explicitly here. More
+ * precisely, the compound condition below takes into account
+ * also the fact that, even if bfqq is being weight-raised,
+ * the scenario is still symmetric if all queues with requests
+ * waiting for completion happen to be
+ * weight-raised. Actually, we should be even more precise
+ * here, and differentiate between interactive weight raising
+ * and soft real-time weight raising.
+ *
+ * As a side note, it is worth considering that the above
+ * device-idling countermeasures may however fail in the
+ * following unlucky scenario: if idling is (correctly)
+ * disabled in a time period during which all symmetry
+ * sub-conditions hold, and hence the device is allowed to
+ * enqueue many requests, but at some later point in time some
+ * sub-condition stops to hold, then it may become impossible
+ * to let requests be served in the desired order until all
+ * the requests already queued in the device have been served.
