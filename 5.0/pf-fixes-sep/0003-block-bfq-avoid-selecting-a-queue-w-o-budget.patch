Subject: [PATCH 03/15] block, bfq: avoid selecting a queue w/o budget

To boost throughput on devices with internal queueing and in scenarios
where device idling is not strictly needed, bfq immediately starts
serving a new bfq_queue if the in-service bfq_queue remains without
pending I/O, even if new I/O may arrive soon for the latter
queue. Then, if such I/O actually arrives soon, bfq preempts the new
in-service bfq_queue so as to give the previous queue a chance to go
on being served (in case the previous queue should actually be the one
to be served, according to its timestamps).

However, the in-service bfq_queue, say Q, may also be without further
budget when it remains also pending I/O. Since bfq changes budgets
dynamically to fit the needs of bfq_queues, this happens more often
than one may expect. If this happens, then there is no point in trying
to go on serving Q when new I/O arrives for it soon: Q would be
expired immediately after being selected for service. This would only
cause useless overhead. This commit avoids such a useless selection.
