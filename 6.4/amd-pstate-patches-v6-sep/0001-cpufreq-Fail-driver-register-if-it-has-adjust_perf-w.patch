Subject: [PATCH 01/11] cpufreq: Fail driver register if it has adjust_perf
 without fast_switch

If fast_switch_possible flag is set by the scaling driver, the governor
is free to select fast_switch function even if adjust_perf is set.  Some
scaling drivers which use adjust_perf don't set fast_switch thinking
that the governor would never fall back to fast_switch. But the governor
can fall back to fast_switch even in runtime if frequency invariance is
disabled due to some reason. This could crash the kernel if the driver
didn't set the fast_switch function pointer.

Therefore, fail driver registration if it has adjust_perf without
fast_switch.
