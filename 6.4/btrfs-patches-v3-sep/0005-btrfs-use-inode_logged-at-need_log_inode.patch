Subject: [PATCH 05/12] btrfs: use inode_logged() at need_log_inode()

At need_log_inode() we directly check the ->logged_trans field of the
given inode to check if it was previously logged in the transaction, with
the goal of skipping logging the inode again when it's not necessary.
The ->logged_trans field in not persisted in the inode item or elsewhere,
it's only stored in memory (struct btrfs_inode), so it's transient and
lost once the inode is evicted and then loaded again. Once an inode is
loaded, we are conservative and set ->logged_trans to 0, which may mean
that either the inode was never logged in the current transaction or it
was logged but evicted before being loaded again.

Instead of checking the inode's ->logged_trans field directly, we can
use instead the helper inode_logged(), which will really check if the
inode was logged before in the current transaction in case we have a
->logged_trans field with a value of 0. This will prevent unnecessarily
logging an inode when it's not needed, and in some cases preventing a
transaction commit, in case the logging requires a fallback to a
transaction commit. The following test script shows a scenario where
due to eviction we fallback a transaction commit when trying to fsync
a file that was renamed:

  $ cat test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/nullb0
  MNT=/mnt/nullb0

  num_init_files=10000
  num_new_files=10000

  mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
  mount -o ssd $DEV $MNT

  mkdir $MNT/testdir
  for ((i = 1; i <= $num_init_files; i++)); do
      echo -n > $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  echo -n > $MNT/testdir/foo

  sync

  # Add some files so that there's more work in the transaction other
  # than just renaming file foo.
  for ((i = 1; i <= $num_new_files; i++)); do
      echo -n > $MNT/testdir/new_file_$i
  done

  # Fsync the directory first.
  xfs_io -c "fsync" $MNT/testdir

  # Rename file foo.
  mv $MNT/testdir/foo $MNT/testdir/bar

  # Now triggger eviction of the test directory's inode.
  # Once loaded again, it will have logged_trans set to 0 and
  # last_unlink_trans set to the current transaction.
  echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

  # Fsync file bar (ex-foo).
  # Before the patch the fsync would result in a transaction commit
  # because the inode for file bar has last_unlink_trans set to the
  # current transaction, so it will attempt to log the parent directory
  # as well, which will fallback to a full transaction commit because
  # it also has its last_unlink_trans set to the current transaction,
  # due to the inode eviction.
  start=$(date +%s%N)
  xfs_io -c "fsync" $MNT/testdir/bar
  end=$(date +%s%N)
  dur=$(( (end - start) / 1000000 ))

  echo "file fsync took: $dur milliseconds"

  umount $MNT

Before this patch:  fsync took 22 milliseconds
After this patch:   fsync took  8 milliseconds
