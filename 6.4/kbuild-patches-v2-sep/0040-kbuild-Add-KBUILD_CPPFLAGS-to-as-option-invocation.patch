Subject: [PATCH 40/72] kbuild: Add KBUILD_CPPFLAGS to as-option invocation

After commit feb843a469fb ("kbuild: add $(CLANG_FLAGS) to
KBUILD_CPPFLAGS"), there is an error while building certain PowerPC
assembly files with clang:

  arch/powerpc/lib/copypage_power7.S: Assembler messages:
  arch/powerpc/lib/copypage_power7.S:34: Error: junk at end of line: `0b01000'
  arch/powerpc/lib/copypage_power7.S:35: Error: junk at end of line: `0b01010'
  arch/powerpc/lib/copypage_power7.S:37: Error: junk at end of line: `0b01000'
  arch/powerpc/lib/copypage_power7.S:38: Error: junk at end of line: `0b01010'
  arch/powerpc/lib/copypage_power7.S:40: Error: junk at end of line: `0b01010'
  clang: error: assembler command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

as-option only uses KBUILD_AFLAGS, so after removing CLANG_FLAGS from
KBUILD_AFLAGS, there is no more '--target=' or '--prefix=' flags. As a
result of those missing flags, the host target
will be tested during as-option calls and likely fail, meaning necessary
flags may not get added when building assembly files, resulting in
errors like seen above.

Add KBUILD_CPPFLAGS to as-option invocations to clear up the errors.
This should have been done in commit d5c8d6e0fa61 ("kbuild: Update
assembler calls to use proper flags and language target"), which
switched from using the assembler target to the assembler-with-cpp
target, so flags that affect preprocessing are passed along in all
relevant tests. as-option now mirrors cc-option.
