Subject: [PATCH 13/34] scripts/tags.sh: Resolve gtags empty index generation

gtags considers any file outside of its current working directory
"outside the source tree" and refuses to index it. For O= kernel builds,
or when "make" is invoked from a directory other then the kernel source
tree, gtags ignores the entire kernel source and generates an empty
index.

Force-set gtags current working directory to the kernel source tree.

Due to commit 9da0763bdd82 ("kbuild: Use relative path when building in
a subdir of the source tree"), if the kernel build is done in a
sub-directory of the kernel source tree, the kernel Makefile will set
the kernel's $srctree to ".." for shorter compile-time and run-time
warnings. Consequently, the list of files to be indexed will be in the
"../*" form, rendering all such paths invalid once gtags switches to the
kernel source tree as its current working directory.

If gtags indexing is requested and the build directory is not the kernel
source tree, index all files in absolute-path form.

Note, indexing in absolute-path form will not affect the generated
index, as paths in gtags indices are always relative to the gtags "root
directory" anyway (as evidenced by "gtags --dump").
