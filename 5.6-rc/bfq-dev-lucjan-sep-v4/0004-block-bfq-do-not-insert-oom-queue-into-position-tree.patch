Subject: [PATCH 04/19] block, bfq: do not insert oom queue into position tree

BFQ maintains an ordered list, implemented with an RB tree, of
head-request positions of non-empty bfq_queues. This position tree,
inherited from CFQ, is used to find bfq_queues that contain I/O close
to each other. BFQ merges these bfq_queues into a single shared queue,
if this boosts throughput on the device at hand.

There is however a special-purpose bfq_queue that does not participate
in queue merging, the oom bfq_queue. Yet, also this bfq_queue could be
wrongly added to the position tree. So bfqq_find_close() could return
the oom bfq_queue, which is a source of further troubles in an
out-of-memory situation. This commit prevents the oom bfq_queue from
being inserted into the position tree.
