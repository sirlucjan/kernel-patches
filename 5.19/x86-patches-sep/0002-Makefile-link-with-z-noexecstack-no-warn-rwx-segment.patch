Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Makefile: link with -z noexecstack --no-warn-rwx-segments

Users of GNU ld (BFD) from binutils 2.39+ will observe multiple
instances of a new warning when linking kernels in the form:

  ld: warning: vmlinux: missing .note.GNU-stack section implies executable stack
  ld: NOTE: This behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the linker
  ld: warning: vmlinux has a LOAD segment with RWX permissions

Generally, we would like to avoid the stack being executable.  Because
there could be a need for the stack to be executable, assembler sources
have to opt-in to this security feature via explicit creation of the
.note.GNU-stack feature (which compilers create by default) or command
line flag --noexecstack.  Or we can simply tell the linker the
production of such sections is irrelevant and to link the stack as
--noexecstack.

LLVM's LLD linker defaults to -z noexecstack, so this flag isn't
strictly necessary when linking with LLD, only BFD, but it doesn't hurt
to be explicit here for all linkers IMO.  --no-warn-rwx-segments is
currently BFD specific and only available in the current latest release,
so it's wrapped in an ld-option check.

While the kernel makes extensive usage of ELF sections, it doesn't use
permissions from ELF segments.
