Subject: [PATCH 01/18] btrfs: balance btree dirty pages and delayed items
 after a rename

A rename operation modifies a subvolume's btree, to remove the old dir
item, add the new dir item, remove an inode ref and add a new inode ref.
It can also create the delayed inode for the inodes involved in the
operation, and it creates two delayed dir index items, one to delete
the old name and another one to add the new name.

However we are neither balancing the btree dirty pages nor the delayed
items after a rename, which can result in accumulation of too many
btree dirty pages and delayed items, specially if a task is doing a
series of rename operations (for example it can happen for package
installations/upgrades through the zypper tool).

So just call btrfs_btree_balance_dirty() after a rename, just like we
do for every other system call that results on modifying a btree and
adding delayed items.

Subject: [PATCH 02/18] btrfs: free the path earlier when creating a new inode

When creating an inode, through btrfs_create_new_inode(), we release the
path we allocated before once we don't need it anymore. But we keep it
allocated until we return from that function, which is wasteful because
after we release the path we do several things that can allocate yet
another path: inheriting properties, setting the xattrs used by ACLs and
secutiry modules, adding an orphan item (O_TMPFILE case) or adding a
dir item (for the non-O_TMPFILE case).

So instead of releasing the path once we don't need it anymore, free it
instead. This way we avoid having two paths allocated until we return
from btrfs_create_new_inode().

Subject: [PATCH 03/18] btrfs: balance btree dirty pages and delayed items
 after clone and dedupe

When reflinking extents (clone and deduplication), we need to touch the
btree of the destination inode's subvolume, as well as potentially
create a delayed inode for the destination inode (if it was not created
before). However we are neither balancing the btree dirty pages nor the
delayed items after such operations, so if we have a task that is doing
a long series of clone or deduplication operations, it can result in
accumulation of too many btree dirty pages and delayed items.

So just call btrfs_btree_balance_dirty() after clone and deduplication,
just like we do for every other system call that results on modifying a
btree and adding delayed items.

Subject: [PATCH 04/18] btrfs: add assertions when deleting batches of delayed
 items

There are a few impossible cases that btrfs_batch_delete_items() tries to
deal with:

1) Getting a path pointing to a NULL leaf;
2) The leaf slot is pointing beyond the last item in the leaf;
3) We can't find a single item to delete.

The first case is impossible because the given path was returned by a
successful call to btrfs_search_slot(). Replace the BUG_ON() with an
ASSERT for this.

The second case is impossible because we are always called when a delayed
item matches an item in the given leaf. So add an ASSERT() for that and
if that condition is not satisfied, trigger a warning and return an error.

The third case is impossible exactly because of the same reason as the
second case. The given delayed item matches one item in the leaf, so we
know that our batch always has at least one item. Add an ASSERT to check
that, trigger a warning if that expectation fails and return an error.

Subject: [PATCH 05/18] btrfs: deal with deletion errors when deleting delayed
 items

Currently, btrfs_delete_delayed_items() ignores any errors returned from
btrfs_batch_delete_items(). This looks fishy but it's not a problem at
the moment because:

1) Two of the errors returned from btrfs_batch_delete_items() are for
   impossible cases, cases where a delayed item does not match any item
   in the leaf the path points to - btrfs_delete_delayed_items() always
   calls btrfs_batch_delete_items() with a path that points to a leaf
   that contains an item matching a delayed item;

2) btrfs_batch_delete_items() may return an error from btrfs_del_items(),
   in which case it does not release the delayed items of the batch.

   At the moment this is harmless because btrfs_del_items() actually is
   always able to delete items, even if it returns an error - when it
   returns an error it's because it ended up with a leaf mostly empty
   (less than 1/3 full) and failed to migrate items from that leaf into
   its neighbour leaves - this is not critical, as all the items were
   deleted, we just left the tree a bit unbalanced, but it's still a
   valid tree and causes no harm, and future operations on the tree will
   eventually balance it.

   So even if we get an error from btrfs_del_items(), the delayed items
   will not be released but the next time we run delayed items we will
   find out, at btrfs_delete_delayed_items(), that they are not present
   in the tree anymore and then release them.

This is all a bit subtle, and it's certainly prone to be a disaster in
case btrfs_del_items() changes one day and may return errors before being
able to delete all the requested items, in which case we could leave the
filesystem in an inconsistent state as we would commit a transaction
despite a failure from deleting items from the tree.

So make btrfs_delete_delayed_items() check for any errors from the call
to btrfs_batch_delete_items().

Subject: [PATCH 06/18] btrfs: refactor the delayed item deletion entry point

The delayed item deletion entry point, btrfs_delete_delayed_items(), is a
bit convoluted for a few reasons:

1) It's really a loop disguised with labels and goto statements;

2) There's a 'delete_fail' label which isn't only for error cases, we can
   jump to that label even if no error happened, if we simply don't have
   more delayed items to delete;

3) Unnecessarily keeps track of the current and previous items for no
   good reason, as after getting the next item and releasing the current
   one, it just jumps to the 'again' label just to look again for the
   first delayed item;

4) When a delayed item is not in the tree (because it was already deleted
   before), it releases the item while holding a path locked, which is
   not necessary and adds more contention to the tree, specially taking
   into account that the path came from a deletion search, meaning we have
   write locks for nodes at levels 2, 1 and 0. And releasing the item is
   not computationally trivial (rb tree deletion, a kfree() and some
   trivial things).

So refactor it to use a while loop and add some comments to make it more
obvious why we can have delayed items without a matching item in the tree
as well as why not keep the delayed node locked all the time when running
all its deletion items. This is also a preparation for some upcoming work
involving delayed items.

Subject: [PATCH 07/18] btrfs: improve batch deletion of delayed dir index
 items

Currently we group delayed dir index items for deletion in a single batch
(single btree operation) as long as they all exist in the same leaf and as
long as their keys are sequential in the key space. For example if we have
a leaf that has dir index items with offsets:

    2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10

And we have delayed dir index items for deleting all these indexes, and
no delayed items for any other index keys in between, then we end up
deleting in 3 batches:

1) First batch for indexes 2, 3 and 4;
2) Second batch for indexes 6 and 7;
3) Third batch for index 10.

This is a waste because we can delete all the index keys in a single
batch. What matters is that each consecutive delayed index key matches
each consecutive dir index key in a leaf.

So update the logic at btrfs_batch_delete_items() to check only for a
key match between delayed dir index items and dir index items in a leaf.
Also avoid the useless first iteration on comparing the key of the
first slot to delete with the key of the first delayed item, as it's
silly since they always match, as the delayed item's key was used for
the btree search that gave us the path we have.

This is more efficient and reduces runtime of running delayed items, as
well as lock contention on the subvolume's tree.

For example, the following test script:

  $ cat test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/sdj
  MNT=/mnt/sdj

  mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
  mount $DEV $MNT

  NUM_FILES=1000

  mkdir $MNT/testdir
  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_FILES; i++)); do
      echo -n > $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  # Now delete every other file, to create gaps in the dir index keys.
  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_FILES; i += 2)); do
      rm -f $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  # Sync to force any delayed items to be flushed to the tree.
  sync

  start=$(date +%s%N)
  rm -fr $MNT/testdir
  end=$(date +%s%N)
  dur=$(( (end - start) / 1000000 ))

  echo -e "\nrm -fr took $dur milliseconds"

  umount $MNT

Running that test script while having the following bpftrace script
running in another shell:

  $ cat bpf-measure.sh
  #!/usr/bin/bpftrace

  /* Add 'noinline' to btrfs_delete_delayed_items()'s definition. */
  k:btrfs_delete_delayed_items
  {
      @start_delete_delayed_items[tid] = nsecs;
  }

  k:btrfs_del_items
  /@start_delete_delayed_items[tid]/
  {
      @delete_batches = count();
  }

  kr:btrfs_delete_delayed_items
  /@start_delete_delayed_items[tid]/
  {
      $dur = (nsecs - @start_delete_delayed_items[tid]) / 1000;
      @btrfs_delete_delayed_items_total_time = sum($dur);
      delete(@start_delete_delayed_items[tid]);
  }

Before this change:

@btrfs_delete_delayed_items_total_time: 9563
@delete_batches: 1001

After this change:

@btrfs_delete_delayed_items_total_time: 7328
@delete_batches: 509

Subject: [PATCH 08/18] btrfs: assert that delayed item is a dir index item
 when adding it

All delayed items are for dir index items, we don't support any other item
types at the moment. So simplify __btrfs_add_delayed_item() and add an
assertion for checking the item's key type. This also allows the next
change to be simpler and avoid to check key types. In case we add support
for different item types in the future, then we'll hit the assertion
during development and be able to adjust any code that is assuming delayed
items are always associated to dir index items.

Subject: [PATCH 09/18] btrfs: improve batch insertion of delayed dir index
 items

Currently we group delayed dir index items for insertion as a single batch
(a single btree operation) as long as their keys are sequential in the key
space.

For example we have delayed index items for the following index keys:

   10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 20, 21

We end up building three batches:

1) First one for index keys 10, 11 and 12;
2) Second one for index keys 15 and 16;
3) Third one for index keys 20 and 21.

However, since the dir index numbers come from a monotonically increasing
counter and are never reused, we could group all these items into a single
batch. The existence of holes in the sequence happens only when we had
delayed dir index items for insertion that got deleted before they were
flushed to the subvolume's tree.

The delayed items are stored in a rbtree based on their key order, so
we can just group items into a batch as long as they all fit in a leaf,
and ignore if there's a gap (key offset, index number) between two
consecutive items. This is more efficient and reduces the amount of
time spent when running delayed items if there are gaps between dir
index items.

For example running the following test script:

  $ cat test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/sdj
  MNT=/mnt/sdj

  mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
  mount $DEV $MNT

  NUM_FILES=100

  mkdir $MNT/testdir
  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_FILES; i++)); do
       echo -n > $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  # Now delete every other file, to create gaps in the dir index keys.
  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_FILES; i += 2)); do
      rm -f $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  start=$(date +%s%N)
  sync
  end=$(date +%s%N)
  dur=$(( (end - start) / 1000000 ))

  echo -e "\nsync took $dur milliseconds"

  umount $MNT

While having the following bpftrace script running in another shell:

  $ cat bpf-delayed-items-inserts.sh
  #!/usr/bin/bpftrace

  /* Must add 'noinline' to btrfs_insert_delayed_items(). */
  k:btrfs_insert_delayed_items
  {
      @start_insert_delayed_items[tid] = nsecs;
  }

  k:btrfs_insert_empty_items
  /@start_insert_delayed_items[tid]/
  {
     @insert_batches = count();
  }

  kr:btrfs_insert_delayed_items
  /@start_insert_delayed_items[tid]/
  {
      $dur = (nsecs - @start_insert_delayed_items[tid]) / 1000;
      @btrfs_insert_delayed_items_total_time = sum($dur);
      delete(@start_insert_delayed_items[tid]);
  }

Before this change:

@btrfs_insert_delayed_items_total_time: 576
@insert_batches: 51

After this change:

@btrfs_insert_delayed_items_total_time: 174
@insert_batches: 2

Subject: [PATCH 10/18] btrfs: do not BUG_ON() on failure to reserve metadata
 for delayed item

At btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index(), we don't expect the metadata
reservation for the delayed dir index item insertion to fail, because the
caller is supposed to have reserved 1 unit of metadata space for that.
All callers are able to deal with an error in case that happens, so there
is no need for something so drastic as a BUG_ON() in case of failure.
Instead just emit a warning, so that's easily noticed during development
(fstests in particular), and return the error to the caller.

Subject: [PATCH 11/18] btrfs: set delayed item type when initializing it

Currently we set the type of a delayed item only after successfully
inserting it into its respective rbtree. This is fine, as the type
is not used anywhere before that point, but for the next patch in the
series, there will be the need to check the type of a delayed item
before inserting it into a rbtree.

So set the type of a delayed item immediately after allocating it.
This also makes the trivial wrappers for adding insertion and deletion
useless, so it removes them as well.

Subject: [PATCH 12/18] btrfs: reduce amount of reserved metadata for delayed
 item insertion

Whenever we want to create a new dir index item (when creating an inode,
create a hard link, rename a file) we reserve 1 unit of metadata space
for it in a transaction (that's 256K for a node/leaf size of 16K), and
then create a delayed insertion item for it to be added later to the
subvolume's tree. That unit of metadata is kept until the delayed item
is inserted into the subvolume tree, which may take a while to happen
(in the worst case, it's done only when the transaction commits). If we
have multiple dir index items to insert for the same directory, say N
index items, and they all fit in a single leaf of metadata, then we are
holding N units of reserved metadata space when all we need is 1 unit.

This change addresses that, whenever a new delayed dir index item is
added, we release the unit of metadata the caller has reserved when it
started the transaction if adding that new dir index item does not
result in touching one more metadata leaf, otherwise the reservation
is kept by transferring it from the transaction block reserve to the
delayed items block reserve, just like before. Given that with a leaf
size of 16K we can have a few hundred dir index items in a single leaf
(the exact value depends on file name lengths), this reduces pressure on
metadata reservation by releasing unnecessary space much sooner.

The following fs_mark test showed some improvement when creating many
files in parallel on machine running a non debug kernel (debian's default
kernel config) with 12 cores:

  $ cat test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

Subject: [PATCH 13/18] btrfs: increase direct io read size limit to 256
 sectors

Btrfs currently limits direct I/O reads to a single sector, which goes
back to commit c329861da406 ("Btrfs: don't allocate a separate csums
array for direct reads") from Josef.  That commit changes the direct I/O
code to ".. use the private part of the io_tree for our csums.", but ten
years later that isn't how checksums for direct reads work, instead they
use a csums allocation on a per-btrfs_dio_private basis (which have their
own performance problem for small I/O, but that will be addressed later).

There is no fundamental limit in btrfs itself to limit the I/O size
except for the size of the checksum array that scales linearly with
the number of sectors in an I/O.  Pick a somewhat arbitrary limit of
256 limits, which matches what the buffered reads typically see as
the upper limit as the limit for direct I/O as well.

This significantly improves direct read performance.  For example a fio
run doing 1 MiB aio reads with a queue depth of 1 roughly triples the
throughput:

Baseline:

READ: bw=65.3MiB/s (68.5MB/s), 65.3MiB/s-65.3MiB/s (68.5MB/s-68.5MB/s), io=19.1GiB (20.6GB), run=300013-300013msec

With this patch:

READ: bw=196MiB/s (206MB/s), 196MiB/s-196MiB/s (206MB/s-206MB/s), io=57.5GiB (61.7GB), run=300006-300006msc

Subject: [PATCH 14/18] btrfs: batch up release of reserved metadata for
 delayed items used for deletion

With Filipe's recent rework of the delayed inode code one aspect which
isn't batched is the release of the reserved metadata of delayed inode's
delete items. With this patch on top of Filipe's rework and running the
same test as provided in the description of a patch titled
"btrfs: improve batch deletion of delayed dir index items" I observe
the following change of the number of calls to btrfs_block_rsv_release:

Before this change:
- block_rsv_release:                      1004
- btrfs_delete_delayed_items_total_time: 14602
- delete_batches:                          505

After:
- block_rsv_release:                       510
- btrfs_delete_delayed_items_total_time: 13643
- delete_batches:                          507

Per user request, print the checksum type and implementation at mount
time among the messages. The checksum is user configurable and the
actual crypto implementation is useful to see for performance reasons.
The same information is also available after mount in
/sys/fs/FSID/checksum file.

Example:

Subject: [PATCH 16/18] btrfs: set the objectid of the btree inode's location
 key

We currently don't use the location key of the btree inode, its content
is set to zeroes, as it's a special inode that is not persisted (it has
no inode item stored in any btree).

At btrfs_ino(), an inline function used extensively in btrfs, we have
this special check if the given inode's location objectid is 0, and if it
is, we return the value stored in the VFS' inode i_ino field instead
(which is BTRFS_BTREE_INODE_OBJECTID for the btree inode).

To reduce the code at btrfs_ino(), we can simply set the objectid of the
btree inode to the value BTRFS_BTREE_INODE_OBJECTID. This eliminates the
need to check for the special case of the objectid being zero, with the
side effect of reducing the overall code size and having less code to
execute, as btrfs_ino() is an inline function.

Subject: [PATCH 17/18] btrfs: add optimized btrfs_ino() version for 64 bits
 systems

Currently btrfs_ino() tries to use first the objectid of the inode's
location key. This is to avoid truncation of the inode number on 32 bits
platforms because the i_ino field of struct inode has the unsigned long
type, while the objectid is a 64 bits unsigned type (u64) on every system.
This logic was added in commit 33345d01522f81 ("Btrfs: Always use 64bit
inode number").

However if we are running on a 64 bits system, we can always directly
return the i_ino value from struct inode, which eliminates the need for
he special if statement that tests for a location key type of
BTRFS_ROOT_ITEM_KEY - in which case i_ino may not have the same value as
the objectid in the inode's location objectid, it may have a value of
BTRFS_EMPTY_SUBVOL_DIR_OBJECTID, for the case of snapshots of trees with
subvolumes/snapshots inside them.

So add a special version for 64 bits system that directly returns i_ino
of struct inode. This eliminates one branch and reduces the overall code
size, since btrfs_ino() is an inline function that is extensively used.

Subject: [PATCH 18/18] btrfs: add a force_chunk_alloc to space_info's sysfs

In testing various things such as the btrfsck patch to detect over
allocation of chunks, empty block group deletion, and balance I've had
various ways to force chunk allocations for debug purposes.  Add a sysfs
file to enable forcing of chunk allocation for the owning space info in
order to enable us to add testcases in the future to test these various
features easier.
