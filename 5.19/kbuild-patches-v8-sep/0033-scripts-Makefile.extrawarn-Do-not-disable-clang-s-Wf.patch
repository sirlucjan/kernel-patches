Subject: [PATCH 33/39] scripts/Makefile.extrawarn: Do not disable clang's
 -Wformat-zero-length

There are no instances of this warning in the tree across several
difference architectures and configurations. This was added by
commit 26ea6bb1fef0 ("kbuild, LLVMLinux: Supress warnings unless W=1-3")
back in 2014, where it might have been necessary, but there are no
instances of it now so stop disabling it to increase warning coverage
for clang.
