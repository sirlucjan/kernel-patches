Subject: [PATCH 10/19] btrfs: do not BUG_ON() on failure to reserve metadata
 for delayed item

At btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index(), we don't expect the metadata
reservation for the delayed dir index item insertion to fail, because the
caller is supposed to have reserved 1 unit of metadata space for that.
All callers are able to deal with an error in case that happens, so there
is no need for something so drastic as a BUG_ON() in case of failure.
Instead just emit a warning, so that's easily noticed during development
(fstests in particular), and return the error to the caller.
