Subject: [PATCH 06/31] Revert "scripts/mod/modpost.c: permit '.cranges' secton
 for sh64 architecture."

This reverts commit 4d10c223baab8be8f717df3625cfece5be26dead.

Commit 37744feebc08 ("sh: remove sh5 support") removed the sh64 support
entirely.

Note:
.cranges was only used for sh64 ever.
Commit 211dc24b8744 ("Remove sh5 and sh64 support") in binutils-gdb
already removed the relevant code.
