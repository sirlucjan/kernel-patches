Subject: [PATCH 26/32] Revert "Kbuild, lto, workaround: Don't warn for
 initcall_reference in modpost"

This reverts commit 77ab21adae509c5540956729e2d03bc1a59bc82a.

Even after 8 years later, GCC LTO has not been upstreamed. Also, it said
"This is a workaround". If this is needed in the future, it should be
added in a proper way.
