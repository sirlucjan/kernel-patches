Subject: [PATCH 05/16] ACPI: skip IRQ override on AMD Zen platforms

IRQ override isn't needed on modern AMD Zen systems.
There's an active low keyboard IRQ on AMD Ryzen 6000 and it will stay
this way on newer platforms. This IRQ override breaks keyboards for
almost all Ryzen 6000 laptops currently on the market.

Skip this IRQ override for all AMD Zen platforms because this IRQ
override is supposed to be a workaround for buggy ACPI DSDT and we can't
have a long list of all future AMD CPUs/Laptops in the kernel code.
If a device with buggy ACPI DSDT shows up, a separated list containing
just them should be created.
