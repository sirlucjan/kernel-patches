Subject: [PATCH 41/76] bfq: Split shared queues on move between cgroups

When bfqq is shared by multiple processes it can happen that one of the
processes gets moved to a different cgroup (or just starts submitting IO
for different cgroup). In case that happens we need to split the merged
bfqq as otherwise we will have IO for multiple cgroups in one bfqq and
we will just account IO time to wrong entities etc.

Similarly if the bfqq is scheduled to merge with another bfqq but the
merge didn't happen yet, cancel the merge as it need not be valid
anymore.
