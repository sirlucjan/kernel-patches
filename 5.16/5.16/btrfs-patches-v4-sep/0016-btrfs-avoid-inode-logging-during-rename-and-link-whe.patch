Subject: [PATCH 16/23] btrfs: avoid inode logging during rename and link when
 possible

During a rename or link operation, we need to determine if an inode was
previously logged or not, and if it was, do some update to the logged
inode. We used to rely exclusively on the logged_trans field of struct
btrfs_inode to determine that, but that was not reliable because the
value of that field is not persisted in the inode item, so it's lost
when an inode is evicted and loaded back again. That led to several
issues in the past, such as not persisting deletions (such as the case
fixed by commit 803f0f64d17769 ("Btrfs: fix fsync not persisting dentry
deletions due to inode evictions")), or resulting in losing a file
after an inode eviction followed by a rename (commit ecc64fab7d49c6
("btrfs: fix lost inode on log replay after mix of fsync, rename and
inode eviction")), besides other issues.

So the inode_logged() helper was introduced and used to determine if an
inode was possibly logged before in the current transaction, with the
caveat that it could return false positives, in the sense that even if an
inode was not logged before in the current transaction, it could still
return true, but never to return false in case the inode was logged.
From a functional point of view that is fine, but from a performance
perspective it can introduce significant latencies to rename and link
operations, as they will end up doing inode logging even when it is not
necessary.

Recently on a 5.15 kernel, an openSUSE Tumbleweed user reported package
installations and upgrades, with the zypper tool, were often taking a
long time to complete. With strace it could be observed that zypper was
spending about 99% of its time on rename operations, and then with
further analysis we checked that directory logging was happening too
frequently. Taking into account that installation/upgrade of some of the
packages needed a few thousand file renames, the slowdown was very
noticeable for the user.

The issue was caused indirectly due to an excessive number of inode
evictions on a 5.15 kernel, about 100x more compared to a 5.13, 5.14 or
a 5.16-rc8 kernel. While triggering the inode evictions if something
outside btrfs' control, btrfs could still behave better by eliminating
the false positives from the inode_logged() helper.

So change inode_logged() to actually eliminate such false positives caused
by inode eviction and when an inode was never logged since the filesystem
was mounted, as both cases relate to when the logges_trans field of struct
btrfs_inode has a value of zero. When it can not determine if the inode
was logged based only on the logged_trans value, lookup for the existence
of the inode item in the log tree - if it's there then we known the inode
was logged, if it's not there then it can not have been logged in the
current transaction. Once we determine if the inode was logged, update
the logged_trans value to avoid future calls to have to search in the log
tree again.

Alternatively, we could start storing logged_trans in the on disk inode
item structure (struct btrfs_inode_item) in the unused space it still has,
but that would be a bit odd because:

1) We only care about logged_trans since the filesystem was mounted, we
   don't care about its value from a previous mount. Having it persisted
   in the inode item structure would not make the best use of the precious
   unused space;

2) In order to get logged_trans persisted before inode eviction, we would
   have to update the delayed inode when we finish logging the inode and
   update its logged_trans in struct btrfs_inode, which makes it a bit
   cumbersome since we need to check if the delayed inode exists, if not
   create it and populate it and deal with any errors (-ENOMEM mostly).

This change is part of a patchset comprised of the following patches:

  1/5 btrfs: add helper to delete a dir entry from a log tree
  2/5 btrfs: pass the dentry to btrfs_log_new_name() instead of the inode
  3/5 btrfs: avoid logging all directory changes during renames
  4/5 btrfs: stop doing unnecessary log updates during a rename
  5/5 btrfs: avoid inode logging during rename and link when possible

The following test script mimics part of what the zypper tool does during
package installations/upgrades. It does not triggers inode evictions, but
it's similar because it triggers false positives from the inode_logged()
helper, because the inodes have a logged_trans of 0, there's a log tree
due to a fsync of an unrelated file and the directory inode has its
last_trans field set to the current transaction:

  $ cat test.sh

  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/nvme0n1
  MNT=/mnt/nvme0n1

  NUM_FILES=10000

  mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
  mount $DEV $MNT

  mkdir $MNT/testdir

  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_FILES; i++)); do
      echo -n > $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  sync

  # Now do some change to an unrelated file and fsync it.
  # This is just to create a log tree to make sure that inode_logged()
  # does not return false when called against "testdir".
  xfs_io -f -c "pwrite 0 4K" -c "fsync" $MNT/foo

  # Do some change to testdir. This is to make sure inode_logged()
  # will return true when called against "testdir", because its
  # logged_trans is 0, it was changed in the current transaction
  # and there's a log tree.
  echo -n > $MNT/testdir/file_$((NUM_FILES + 1))

  echo "Renaming $NUM_FILES files..."
  start=$(date +%s%N)
  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_FILES; i++)); do
      mv $MNT/testdir/file_$i $MNT/testdir/file_$i-RPMDELETE
  done
  end=$(date +%s%N)

  dur=$(( (end - start) / 1000000 ))
  echo "Renames took $dur milliseconds"

  umount $MNT

kernel config) gave the following results:
