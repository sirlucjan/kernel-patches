Subject: [PATCH 2/3] ZEN: intel-pstate: Implement "enable" parameter

If intel-pstate is compiled into the kernel, it will preempt the loading
of acpi-cpufreq so you can take advantage of hardware p-states without
any friction.

However, intel-pstate is not completely superior to cpufreq's ondemand
for one reason.  There's no concept of an up_threshold property.

In ondemand, up_threshold essentially reduces the maximum utilization to
compare against, allowing you to hit max frequencies and turbo boost
from a much lower core utilization.

With intel-pstate, you have the concept of minimum and maximum
performance, but no tunable that lets you define, maximum frequency
means 50% core utilization.  For just this oversight, there's reasons
you may want ondemand.

Lets support setting "enable" in kernel boot parameters.  This lets
kernel maintainers include "intel_pstate=disable" statically in the
static boot parameters, but let users of the kernel override this
selection.
