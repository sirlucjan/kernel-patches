Subject: [PATCH 75/75] bfq: Update cgroup information before merging bio

When the process is migrated to a different cgroup (or in case of
writeback just starts submitting bios associated with a different
cgroup) bfq_merge_bio() can operate with stale cgroup information in
bic. Thus the bio can be merged to a request from a different cgroup or
it can result in merging of bfqqs for different cgroups or bfqqs of
already dead cgroups and causing possible use-after-free issues. Fix the
problem by updating cgroup information in bfq_merge_bio().
