Subject: [PATCH 15/75] bfq: Limit number of requests consumed by each cgroup
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When cgroup IO scheduling is used with BFQ it does not really provide
service differentiation if the cgroup drives a big IO depth. That for
example happens with writeback which asynchronously submits lots of IO
but it can happen with AIO as well. The problem is that if we have two
cgroups that submit IO with different weights, the cgroup with higher
weight properly gets more IO time and is able to dispatch more IO.
However this causes lower weight cgroup to accumulate more requests
inside BFQ and eventually lower weight cgroup consumes most of IO
scheduler tags. At that point higher weight cgroup stops getting better
service as it is mostly blocked waiting for a scheduler tag while its
queues inside BFQ are empty and thus lower weight cgroup gets served.

Check how many requests submitting cgroup has allocated in
bfq_limit_depth() and if it consumes more requests than what would
correspond to its weight limit available depth to 1 so that the cgroup
cannot consume many more requests. With this limitation the higher
weight cgroup gets proper service even with writeback.
