Subject: [PATCH 26/73] block, bfq: do not idle if only one cgroup is activated

Now that root group is counted into 'num_groups_with_pending_reqs',
'num_groups_with_pending_reqs > 0' is always true in
bfq_asymmetric_scenario().

If only one group is activated, there is no need to guarantee the
same share of the throughput of queues in the same group. Thus change
the condition to 'num_groups_with_pending_reqs > 1'.
