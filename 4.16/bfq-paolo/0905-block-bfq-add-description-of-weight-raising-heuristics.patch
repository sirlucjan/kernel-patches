A description of how weight raising works is missing in BFQ
sources. In addition, the code for handling weight raising is
scattered across a few functions. This makes it rather hard to
understand the mechanism and its rationale. This commits adds such a
description at the beginning of the main source file.

  * In particular, to provide these low-latency guarantees, BFQ
  * explicitly privileges the I/O of two classes of time-sensitive
- * applications: interactive and soft real-time. This feature enables
- * BFQ to provide applications in these classes with a very low
- * latency. Finally, BFQ also features additional heuristics for
+ * applications: interactive and soft real-time. In more detail, BFQ
+ * behaves this way if the low_latency parameter is set (default
+ * configuration). This feature enables BFQ to provide applications in
+ * these classes with a very low latency.
+ *
+ * To implement this feature, BFQ constantly tries to detect whether
+ * the I/O requests in a bfq_queue come from an interactive or a soft
+ * real-time application. For brevity, in these cases, the queue is
+ * said to be interactive or soft real-time. In both cases, BFQ
+ * privileges the service of the queue, over that of non-interactive
+ * and non-soft-real-time queues. This privileging is performed,
+ * mainly, by raising the weight of the queue. So, for brevity, we
+ * call just weight-raising periods the time periods during which a
+ * queue is privileged, because deemed interactive or soft real-time.
+ *
+ * The detection of soft real-time queues/applications is described in
+ * detail in the comments on the function
+ * bfq_bfqq_softrt_next_start. On the other hand, the detection of an
+ * interactive queue works as follows: a queue is deemed interactive
+ * if it is constantly non empty only for a limited time interval,
+ * after which it does become empty. The queue may be deemed
+ * interactive again (for a limited time), if it restarts being
+ * constantly non empty, provided that this happens only after the
+ * queue has remained empty for a given minimum idle time.
+ *
+ * By default, BFQ computes automatically the above maximum time
+ * interval, i.e., the time interval after which a constantly
+ * non-empty queue stops being deemed interactive. Since a queue is
+ * weight-raised while it is deemed interactive, this maximum time
+ * interval happens to coincide with the (maximum) duration of the
+ * weight-raising for interactive queues.
+ *
+ * Finally, BFQ also features additional heuristics for
  * preserving both a low latency and a high throughput on NCQ-capable,
  * rotational or flash-based devices, and to get the job done quickly
  * for applications consisting in many I/O-bound processes.
