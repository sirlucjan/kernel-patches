If two processes do I/O close to each other, then BFQ merges the
bfq_queues associated with these processes, to get a more sequential
I/O, and thus a higher throughput.  In this respect, to detect whether
two processes are doing I/O close to each other, BFQ keeps a list of
the head-of-line I/O requests of all active bfq_queues.  The list is
ordered by initial sectors, and implemented through a red-black tree
(rq_pos_tree).

Unfortunately, the update of the rq_pos_tree was incomplete, because
the tree was not updated on the removal of the head-of-line I/O
request of a bfq_queue, in case the queue did not remain empty. This
commit adds the missing update.
