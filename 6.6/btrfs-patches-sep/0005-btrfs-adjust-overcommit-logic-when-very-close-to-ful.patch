Subject: [PATCH 5/5] btrfs: adjust overcommit logic when very close to full

A user reported some unpleasant behavior with very small file systems.
The reproducer is this

mkfs.btrfs -f -m single -b 8g /dev/vdb
mount /dev/vdb /mnt/test
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test/testfile bs=512M count=20

This will result in usage that looks like this

Overall:
    Device size:                   8.00GiB
    Device allocated:              8.00GiB
    Device unallocated:            1.00MiB
    Device missing:                  0.00B
    Device slack:                  2.00GiB
    Used:                          5.47GiB
    Free (estimated):              2.52GiB      (min: 2.52GiB)
    Free (statfs, df):               0.00B
    Data ratio:                       1.00
    Metadata ratio:                   1.00
    Global reserve:                5.50MiB      (used: 0.00B)
    Multiple profiles:                  no

Data,single: Size:7.99GiB, Used:5.46GiB (68.41%)
   /dev/vdb        7.99GiB

Metadata,single: Size:8.00MiB, Used:5.77MiB (72.07%)
   /dev/vdb        8.00MiB

System,single: Size:4.00MiB, Used:16.00KiB (0.39%)
   /dev/vdb        4.00MiB

Unallocated:
   /dev/vdb        1.00MiB

As you can see we've gotten ourselves quite full with metadata, with all
of the disk being allocated for data.

On smaller file systems there's not a lot of time before we get full, so
our overcommit behavior bites us here.  Generally speaking data
reservations result in chunk allocations as we assume reservation ==
actual use for data.  This means at any point we could end up with a
chunk allocation for data, and if we're very close to full we could do
this before we have a chance to figure out that we need another metadata
chunk.

Address this by adjusting the overcommit logic.  Simply put we need to
take away 1 chunk from the available chunk space in case of a data
reservation.  This will allow us to stop overcommitting before we
potentially lose this space to a data allocation.  With this fix in
place we properly allocate a metadata chunk before we're completely
full, allowing for enough slack space in metadata.
