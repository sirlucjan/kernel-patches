Subject: [PATCH 28/29] ksmbd: force "fail immediately" flag on fs with its own
 ->lock

Like nfsd and lockd, ksmbd can cause deadlock if the exported
file system does not support asynchronous processing of blocking locks:
if all ksmbd worker threads handles such requests,
they can never finish and the server will not be able to handle
any other incoming requests.

Any filesystem that leaves ->lock NULL will use posix_lock_file(), which
does the right thing. Simplest is just to assume that any filesystem
that defines its own ->lock is not safe to request a blocking lock from.

To work around the problem we need to drop fl->fl_flag FL_SLEEP before
vfs_lock_file() execution, it forces affected functions to avoid blocking.
