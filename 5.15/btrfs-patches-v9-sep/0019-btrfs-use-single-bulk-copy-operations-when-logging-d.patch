Subject: [PATCH 19/42] btrfs: use single bulk copy operations when logging
 directories

When logging a directory and inserting a batch of directory items, we are
copying the data of each item from a leaf in the fs/subvolume tree to a
leaf in a log tree, separately. This is not really needed, since we are
copying from a contiguous memory area into another one, so we can use a
single copy operation to copy all items at once.

This patch is part of a small patchset that is comprised of the following
patches:

  btrfs: loop only once over data sizes array when inserting an item batch
  btrfs: unexport setup_items_for_insert()
  btrfs: use single bulk copy operations when logging directories

This is patch 3/3.

The following test was used to compare performance of a branch without the
patchset versus one branch that has the whole patchset applied:

  $ cat dir-fsync-test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/nvme0n1
  MNT=/mnt/nvme0n1

  NUM_NEW_FILES=1000000
  NUM_FILE_DELETES=1000
  LEAF_SIZE=16K

  mkfs.btrfs -f -n $LEAF_SIZE $DEV
  mount -o ssd $DEV $MNT

  mkdir $MNT/testdir

  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_NEW_FILES; i++)); do
      echo -n > $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  # Fsync the directory, this will log the new dir items and the inodes
  # they point to, because these are new inodes.
  start=$(date +%s%N)
  xfs_io -c "fsync" $MNT/testdir
  end=$(date +%s%N)

  dur=$(( (end - start) / 1000000 ))
  echo "dir fsync took $dur ms after adding $NUM_NEW_FILES files"

  # sync to force transaction commit and wipeout the log.
  sync

  del_inc=$(( $NUM_NEW_FILES / $NUM_FILE_DELETES ))
  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_NEW_FILES; i += $del_inc)); do
      rm -f $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  # Fsync the directory, this will only log dir items, there are no
  # dentries pointing to new inodes.
  start=$(date +%s%N)
  xfs_io -c "fsync" $MNT/testdir
  end=$(date +%s%N)

  dur=$(( (end - start) / 1000000 ))
  echo "dir fsync took $dur ms after deleting $NUM_FILE_DELETES files"

  umount $MNT

The tests were run on a non-debug kernel (Debian's default kernel config)
and were the following:

*** with a leaf size of 16K, before patchset ***

dir fsync took 8482 ms after adding 1000000 files
dir fsync took 166 ms after deleting 1000 files

*** with a leaf size of 16K, after patchset ***

dir fsync took 8196 ms after adding 1000000 files  (-3.4%)
dir fsync took 143 ms after deleting 1000 files    (-14.9%)

*** with a leaf size of 64K, before patchset ***

dir fsync took 12851 ms after adding 1000000 files
dir fsync took 466 ms after deleting 1000 files

*** with a leaf size of 64K, after  patchset ***

dir fsync took 12287 ms after adding 1000000 files (-4.5%)
dir fsync took 414 ms after deleting 1000 files    (-11.8%)
