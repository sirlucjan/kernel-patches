Subject: [PATCH 01/22] x86/cpufeatures: add AMD Collaborative Processor
 Performance Control feature flag

Add Collaborative Processor Performance Control feature flag for AMD
processors.

This feature flag will be used on the following amd-pstate driver. The
amd-pstate driver has two approaches to implement the frequency control
behavior. That depends on the CPU hardware implementation. One is "Full
MSR Support" and another is "Shared Memory Support". The feature flag
indicates the current processors with "Full MSR Support".
