Subject: [PATCH 06/31] mm: introduce CONFIG_SPECULATIVE_PAGE_FAULT

This configuration variable will be used to build the code needed to
handle speculative page fault.

This is enabled by default on supported architectures with SMP and MMU set.

The architecture support is needed since the speculative page fault handler
is called from the architecture's page faulting code, and some code has to
be added there to try speculative fault handling first.

+	  Try to handle user space page faults without holding the mmap lock.
+
+	  Instead of blocking writers through the use of mmap lock,
+	  the page fault handler merely verifies, at the end of the page
+	  fault, that no writers have been running concurrently with it.
+
+	  In high concurrency situations, the speculative fault handler
+	  gains a throughput advantage by avoiding having to update the
+	  mmap lock reader count.
+
+	  If the check fails due to a concurrent writer, or due to hitting
+	  an unsupported case, the fault handler falls back to classical
+	  processing using the mmap read lock.
