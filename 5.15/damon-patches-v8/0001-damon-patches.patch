Subject: [PATCH 06/34] mm/damon/core: account age of target regions

Patch series "Implement Data Access Monitoring-based Memory Operation Schemes".

Introduction
============

DAMON[1] can be used as a primitive for data access aware memory
management optimizations.  For that, users who want such optimizations
should run DAMON, read the monitoring results, analyze it, plan a new
memory management scheme, and apply the new scheme by themselves.  Such
efforts will be inevitable for some complicated optimizations.

However, in many other cases, the users would simply want the system to
apply a memory management action to a memory region of a specific size
having a specific access frequency for a specific time.  For example,
"page out a memory region larger than 100 MiB keeping only rare accesses
more than 2 minutes", or "Do not use THP for a memory region larger than
2 MiB rarely accessed for more than 1 seconds".

To make the works easier and non-redundant, this patchset implements a
new feature of DAMON, which is called Data Access Monitoring-based
Operation Schemes (DAMOS).  Using the feature, users can describe the
normal schemes in a simple way and ask DAMON to execute those on its
own.

[1] https://damonitor.github.io

Evaluations
===========

DAMOS is accurate and useful for memory management optimizations.  An
experimental DAMON-based operation scheme for THP, 'ethp', removes
76.15% of THP memory overheads while preserving 51.25% of THP speedup.
Another experimental DAMON-based 'proactive reclamation' implementation,
'prcl', reduces 93.38% of residential sets and 23.63% of system memory
footprint while incurring only 1.22% runtime overhead in the best case
(parsec3/freqmine).

NOTE that the experimental THP optimization and proactive reclamation
are not for production but only for proof of concepts.

Please refer to the showcase web site's evaluation document[1] for
detailed evaluation setup and results.

[1] https://damonitor.github.io/doc/html/v34/vm/damon/eval.html

Long-term Support Trees
-----------------------

For people who want to test DAMON but using LTS kernels, there are
another couple of trees based on two latest LTS kernels respectively and
containing the 'damon/master' backports.

- For v5.4.y: https://git.kernel.org/sj/h/damon/for-v5.4.y
- For v5.10.y: https://git.kernel.org/sj/h/damon/for-v5.10.y

Sequence Of Patches
===================

The 1st patch accounts age of each region.  The 2nd patch implements the
core of the DAMON-based operation schemes feature.  The 3rd patch makes
the default monitoring primitives for virtual address spaces to support
the schemes.  From this point, the kernel space users can use DAMOS.
The 4th patch exports the feature to the user space via the debugfs
interface.  The 5th patch implements schemes statistics feature for
easier tuning of the schemes and runtime access pattern analysis, and
the 6th patch adds selftests for these changes.  Finally, the 7th patch
documents this new feature.

This patch (of 7):

DAMON can be used for data access pattern aware memory management
optimizations.  For that, users should run DAMON, read the monitoring
results, analyze it, plan a new memory management scheme, and apply the
new scheme by themselves.  It would not be too hard, but still require
some level of effort.  For complicated cases, this effort is inevitable.

That said, in many cases, users would simply want to apply an actions to
a memory region of a specific size having a specific access frequency
for a specific time.  For example, "page out a memory region larger than
100 MiB but having a low access frequency more than 10 minutes", or "Use
THP for a memory region larger than 2 MiB having a high access frequency
for more than 2 seconds".

For such optimizations, users will need to first account the age of each
region themselves.  To reduce such efforts, this implements a simple age
account of each region in DAMON.  For each aggregation step, DAMON
compares the access frequency with that from last aggregation and reset
the age of the region if the change is significant.  Else, the age is
incremented.  Also, in case of the merge of regions, the region
size-weighted average of the ages is set as the age of merged new
region.

Subject: [PATCH 07/34] mm/damon/core: implement DAMON-based Operation Schemes
 (DAMOS)

In many cases, users might use DAMON for simple data access aware memory
management optimizations such as applying an operation scheme to a
memory region of a specific size having a specific access frequency for
a specific time.  For example, "page out a memory region larger than 100
MiB but having a low access frequency more than 10 minutes", or "Use THP
for a memory region larger than 2 MiB having a high access frequency for
more than 2 seconds".

Most simple form of the solution would be doing offline data access
pattern profiling using DAMON and modifying the application source code
or system configuration based on the profiling results.  Or, developing
a daemon constructed with two modules (one for access monitoring and the
other for applying memory management actions via mlock(), madvise(),
sysctl, etc) is imaginable.

To avoid users spending their time for implementation of such simple
data access monitoring-based operation schemes, this makes DAMON to
handle such schemes directly.  With this change, users can simply
specify their desired schemes to DAMON.  Then, DAMON will automatically
apply the schemes to the user-specified target processes.

Each of the schemes is composed with conditions for filtering of the
target memory regions and desired memory management action for the
target.  Specifically, the format is::

    <min/max size> <min/max access frequency> <min/max age> <action>

The filtering conditions are size of memory region, number of accesses
to the region monitored by DAMON, and the age of the region.  The age of
region is incremented periodically but reset when its addresses or
access frequency has significantly changed or the action of a scheme was
applied.  For the action, current implementation supports a few of
madvise()-like hints, ``WILLNEED``, ``COLD``, ``PAGEOUT``, ``HUGEPAGE``,
and ``NOHUGEPAGE``.

Because DAMON supports various address spaces and application of the
actions to a monitoring target region is dependent to the type of the
target address space, the application code should be implemented by each
primitives and registered to the framework.  Note that this only
implements the framework part.  Following commit will implement the
action applications for virtual address spaces primitives.

Subject: [PATCH 08/34] mm/damon/vaddr: support DAMON-based Operation Schemes

This makes DAMON's default primitives for virtual address spaces to
support DAMON-based Operation Schemes (DAMOS) by implementing actions
application functions and registering it to the monitoring context.  The
implementation simply links 'madvise()' for related DAMOS actions.  That
is, 'madvise(MADV_WILLNEED)' is called for 'WILLNEED' DAMOS action and
similar for other actions ('COLD', 'PAGEOUT', 'HUGEPAGE', 'NOHUGEPAGE').

So, the kernel space DAMON users can now use the DAMON-based
optimizations with only small amount of code.

Subject: [PATCH 10/34] mm/damon/schemes: implement statistics feature

To tune the DAMON-based operation schemes, knowing how many and how
large regions are affected by each of the schemes will be helful.  Those
stats could be used for not only the tuning, but also monitoring of the
working set size and the number of regions, if the scheme does not
change the program behavior too much.

For the reason, this implements the statistics for the schemes.  The
total number and size of the regions that each scheme is applied are
exported to users via '->stat_count' and '->stat_sz' of 'struct damos'.
Admins can also check the number by reading 'schemes' debugfs file.  The
last two integers now represents the stats.  To allow collecting the
stats without changing the program behavior, this also adds new scheme
action, 'DAMOS_STAT'.  Note that 'DAMOS_STAT' is not only making no
memory operation actions, but also does not reset the age of regions.

Subject: [PATCH 11/34] mm/damon/dbgfs: allow users to set initial monitoring
 target regions

Patch series "DAMON: Support Physical Memory Address Space Monitoring:.

DAMON currently supports only virtual address spaces monitoring.  It can
be easily extended for various use cases and address spaces by
configuring its monitoring primitives layer to use appropriate
primitives implementations, though.  This patchset implements monitoring
primitives for the physical address space monitoring using the
structure.

The first 3 patches allow the user space users manually set the
monitoring regions.  The 1st patch implements the feature in the
'damon-dbgfs'.  Then, patches for adding a unit tests (the 2nd patch)
and updating the documentation (the 3rd patch) follow.

Following 4 patches implement the physical address space monitoring
primitives.  The 4th patch makes some primitive functions for the
virtual address spaces primitives reusable.  The 5th patch implements
the physical address space monitoring primitives.  The 6th patch links
the primitives to the 'damon-dbgfs'.  Finally, 7th patch documents this
new features.

This patch (of 7):

Some 'damon-dbgfs' users would want to monitor only a part of the entire
virtual memory address space.  The program interface users in the kernel
space could use '->before_start()' callback or set the regions inside
the context struct as they want, but 'damon-dbgfs' users cannot.

For that reason, this introduces a new debugfs file called
'init_region'.  'damon-dbgfs' users can specify which initial monitoring
target address regions they want by writing special input to the file.
The input should describe each region in each line in the below form:

    <pid> <start address> <end address>

Note that the regions will be updated to cover entire memory mapped
regions after a 'regions update interval' is passed.  If you want the
regions to not be updated after the initial setting, you could set the
interval as a very long time, say, a few decades.

Subject: [PATCH 14/34] mm/damon: implement primitives for physical address
 space monitoring

This implements the monitoring primitives for the physical memory
address space.  Internally, it uses the PTE Accessed bit, similar to
that of the virtual address spaces monitoring primitives.  It supports
only user memory pages, as idle pages tracking does.  If the monitoring
target physical memory address range contains non-user memory pages,
access check of the pages will do nothing but simply treat the pages as
not accessed.

Subject: [PATCH 15/34] mm/damon/dbgfs: support physical memory monitoring

This makes the 'damon-dbgfs' to support the physical memory monitoring,
in addition to the virtual memory monitoring.

Users can do the physical memory monitoring by writing a special
keyword, 'paddr' to the 'target_ids' debugfs file.  Then, DAMON will
check the special keyword and configure the monitoring context to run
with the primitives for the physical address space.

Unlike the virtual memory monitoring, the monitoring target region will
not be automatically set.  Therefore, users should also set the
monitoring target address region using the 'init_regions' debugfs file.

Also, note that the physical memory monitoring will not automatically
terminated.  The user should explicitly turn off the monitoring by
writing 'off' to the 'monitor_on' debugfs file.

The only usage of these structs is to pass their addresses to

Subject: [PATCH 18/34] mm/damon/paddr: support the pageout scheme

Introduction
============

This patchset 1) makes the engine for general data access
pattern-oriented memory management (DAMOS) be more useful for production
environments, and 2) implements a static kernel module for lightweight
proactive reclamation using the engine.

Proactive Reclamation
---------------------

On general memory over-committed systems, proactively reclaiming cold
pages helps saving memory and reducing latency spikes that incurred by
the direct reclaim or the CPU consumption of kswapd, while incurring
only minimal performance degradation[2].

A Free Pages Reporting[8] based memory over-commit virtualization system
would be one more specific use case.  In the system, the guest VMs
reports their free memory to host, and the host reallocates the reported
memory to other guests.  As a result, the system's memory utilization
can be maximized.  However, the guests could be not so memory-frugal,
because some kernel subsystems and user-space applications are designed
to use as much memory as available.  Then, guests would report only
small amount of free memory to host, results in poor memory utilization.
Running the proactive reclamation in such guests could help mitigating
this problem.

Google has also implemented this idea and using it in their data center.
They further proposed upstreaming it in LSFMM'19, and "the general
consensus was that, while this sort of proactive reclaim would be useful
for a number of users, the cost of this particular solution was too high
to consider merging it upstream"[3].  The cost mainly comes from the
coldness tracking.  Roughly speaking, the implementation periodically
scans the 'Accessed' bit of each page.  For the reason, the overhead
linearly increases as the size of the memory and the scanning frequency
grows.  As a result, Google is known to dedicating one CPU for the work.
That's a reasonable option to someone like Google, but it wouldn't be so
to some others.

DAMON and DAMOS: An engine for data access pattern-oriented memory management
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DAMON[4] is a framework for general data access monitoring.  Its
adaptive monitoring overhead control feature minimizes its monitoring
overhead.  It also let the upper-bound of the overhead be configurable
by clients, regardless of the size of the monitoring target memory.
While monitoring 70 GiB memory of a production system every 5
milliseconds, it consumes less than 1% single CPU time.  For this, it
could sacrify some of the quality of the monitoring results.
Nevertheless, the lower-bound of the quality is configurable, and it
uses a best-effort algorithm for better quality.  Our test results[5]
show the quality is practical enough.  From the production system
monitoring, we were able to find a 4 KiB region in the 70 GiB memory
that shows highest access frequency.

We normally don't monitor the data access pattern just for fun but to
improve something like memory management.  Proactive reclamation is one
such usage.  For such general cases, DAMON provides a feature called
DAMon-based Operation Schemes (DAMOS)[6].  It makes DAMON an engine for
general data access pattern oriented memory management.  Using this,
clients can ask DAMON to find memory regions of specific data access
pattern and apply some memory management action (e.g., page out, move to
head of the LRU list, use huge page, ...).  We call the request
'scheme'.

Proactive Reclamation on top of DAMON/DAMOS
-------------------------------------------

Therefore, by using DAMON for the cold pages detection, the proactive
reclamation's monitoring overhead issue can be solved.  Actually, we
previously implemented a version of proactive reclamation using DAMOS
and achieved noticeable improvements with our evaluation setup[5].
Nevertheless, it more for a proof-of-concept, rather than production
uses.  It supports only virtual address spaces of processes, and require
additional tuning efforts for given workloads and the hardware.  For the
tuning, we introduced a simple auto-tuning user space tool[8].  Google
is also known to using a ML-based similar approach for their fleets[2].
But, making it just works with intuitive knobs in the kernel would be
helpful for general users.

To this end, this patchset improves DAMOS to be ready for such
production usages, and implements another version of the proactive
reclamation, namely DAMON_RECLAIM, on top of it.

DAMOS Improvements: Aggressiveness Control, Prioritization, and Watermarks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, the current version of DAMOS supports only virtual address
spaces.  This patchset makes it supports the physical address space for
the page out action.

Next major problem of the current version of DAMOS is the lack of the
aggressiveness control, which can results in arbitrary overhead.  For
example, if huge memory regions having the data access pattern of
interest are found, applying the requested action to all of the regions
could incur significant overhead.  It can be controlled by tuning the
target data access pattern with manual or automated approaches[2,7].
But, some people would prefer the kernel to just work with only
intuitive tuning or default values.

For such cases, this patchset implements a safeguard, namely time/size
quota.  Using this, the clients can specify up to how much time can be
used for applying the action, and/or up to how much memory regions the
action can be applied within a user-specified time duration.  A followup
question is, to which memory regions should the action applied within
the limits? We implement a simple regions prioritization mechanism for
each action and make DAMOS to apply the action to high priority regions
first.  It also allows clients tune the prioritization mechanism to use
different weights for size, access frequency, and age of memory regions.
This means we could use not only LRU but also LFU or some fancy
algorithms like CAR[9] with lightweight overhead.

Though DAMON is lightweight, someone would want to remove even the cold
pages monitoring overhead when it is unnecessary.  Currently, it should
manually turned on and off by clients, but some clients would simply
want to turn it on and off based on some metrics like free memory ratio
or memory fragmentation.  For such cases, this patchset implements a
watermarks-based automatic activation feature.  It allows the clients
configure the metric of their interest, and three watermarks of the
metric.  If the metric is higher than the high watermark or lower than
the low watermark, the scheme is deactivated.  If the metric is lower
than the mid watermark but higher than the low watermark, the scheme is
activated.

DAMON-based Reclaim
-------------------

Using the improved version of DAMOS, this patchset implements a static
kernel module called 'damon_reclaim'.  It finds memory regions that
didn't accessed for specific time duration and page out.  Consuming too
much CPU for the paging out operations, or doing pageout too frequently
can be critical for systems configuring their swap devices with
software-defined in-memory block devices like zram/zswap or total number
of writes limited devices like SSDs, respectively.  To avoid the
problems, the time/size quotas can be configured.  Under the quotas, it
pages out memory regions that didn't accessed longer first.  Also, to
remove the monitoring overhead under peaceful situation, and to fall
back to the LRU-list based page granularity reclamation when it doesn't
make progress, the three watermarks based activation mechanism is used,
with the free memory ratio as the watermark metric.

For convenient configurations, it provides several module parameters.
Using these, sysadmins can enable/disable it, and tune its parameters
including the coldness identification time threshold, the time/size
quotas and the three watermarks.

Evaluation
==========

In short, DAMON_RECLAIM with 50ms/s time quota and regions
prioritization on v5.15-rc5 Linux kernel with ZRAM swap device achieves
38.58% memory saving with only 1.94% runtime overhead.  For this,
DAMON_RECLAIM consumes only 4.97% of single CPU time.

Setup
-----

We evaluate DAMON_RECLAIM to show how each of the DAMOS improvements
make effect.  For this, we measure DAMON_RECLAIM's CPU consumption,
entire system memory footprint, total number of major page faults, and
runtime of 24 realistic workloads in PARSEC3 and SPLASH-2X benchmark
suites on my QEMU/KVM based virtual machine.  The virtual machine runs
on an i3.metal AWS instance, has 130GiB memory, and runs a linux kernel
built on latest -mm tree[1] plus this patchset.  It also utilizes a 4
GiB ZRAM swap device.  We repeats the measurement 5 times and use
averages.

Detailed Results
----------------

The results are summarized in the below table.

With coldness identification threshold of 5 seconds, DAMON_RECLAIM
without the time quota-based speed limit achieves 47.21% memory saving,
but incur 4.59% runtime slowdown to the workloads on average.  For this,
DAMON_RECLAIM consumes about 11.28% single CPU time.

Applying time quotas of 200ms/s, 50ms/s, and 10ms/s without the regions
prioritization reduces the slowdown to 4.89%, 2.65%, and 1.5%,
respectively.  Time quota of 200ms/s (20%) makes no real change compared
to the quota unapplied version, because the quota unapplied version
consumes only 11.28% CPU time.  DAMON_RECLAIM's CPU utilization also
similarly reduced: 11.24%, 5.51%, and 2.01% of single CPU time.  That
is, the overhead is proportional to the speed limit.  Nevertheless, it
also reduces the memory saving because it becomes less aggressive.  In
detail, the three variants show 48.76%, 37.83%, and 7.85% memory saving,
respectively.

Applying the regions prioritization (page out regions that not accessed
longer first within the time quota) further reduces the performance
degradation.  Runtime slowdowns and total number of major page faults
increase has been 4.89%/218,690% -> 4.39%/166,136% (200ms/s),
2.65%/111,886% -> 1.94%/59,053% (50ms/s), and 1.5%/34,973.40% ->
2.08%/8,781.75% (10ms/s).  The runtime under 10ms/s time quota has
increased with prioritization, but apparently that's under the margin of
error.

Subject: [PATCH 19/34] mm/damon/schemes: implement size quota for schemes
 application speed control

There could be arbitrarily large memory regions fulfilling the target
data access pattern of a DAMON-based operation scheme.  In the case,
applying the action of the scheme could incur too high overhead.  To
provide an intuitive way for avoiding it, this implements a feature
called size quota.  If the quota is set, DAMON tries to apply the action
only up to the given amount of memory regions within a given time
window.

Subject: [PATCH 20/34] mm/damon/schemes: skip already charged targets and
 regions

If DAMOS has stopped applying action in the middle of a group of memory
regions due to its size quota, it starts the work again from the
beginning of the address space in the next charge window.  If there is a
huge memory region at the beginning of the address space and it fulfills
the scheme's target data access pattern always, the action will applied
to only the region.

This mitigates the case by skipping memory regions that charged in
current charge window at the beginning of next charge window.

Subject: [PATCH 21/34] mm/damon/schemes: implement time quota

The size quota feature of DAMOS is useful for IO resource-critical
systems, but not so intuitive for CPU time-critical systems.  Systems
using zram or zswap-like swap device would be examples.

To provide another intuitive ways for such systems, this implements
time-based quota for DAMON-based Operation Schemes.  If the quota is
set, DAMOS tries to use only up to the user-defined quota of CPU time
within a given time window.

Subject: [PATCH 23/34] mm/damon/schemes: prioritize regions within the quotas

This makes DAMON apply schemes to regions having higher priority first,
if it cannot apply schemes to all regions due to the quotas.

The prioritization function should be implemented in the monitoring
primitives.  Those would commonly calculate the priority of the region
using attributes of regions, namely 'size', 'nr_accesses', and 'age'.
For example, some primitive would calculate the priority of each region
using a weighted sum of 'nr_accesses' and 'age' of the region.

The optimal weights would depend on give environments, so this makes
those customizable.  Nevertheless, the score calculation functions are
only encouraged to respect the weights, not mandated.

Subject: [PATCH 24/34] mm/damon/vaddr,paddr: support pageout prioritization

This makes the default monitoring primitives for virtual address spaces
and the physical address sapce to support memory regions prioritization
for 'PAGEOUT' DAMOS action.  It calculates hotness of each region as
weighted sum of 'nr_accesses' and 'age' of the region and get the
priority score as reverse of the hotness, so that cold regions can be
paged out first.

Subject: [PATCH 26/34] mm/damon/schemes: activate schemes based on a
 watermarks mechanism

DAMON-based operation schemes need to be manually turned on and off.  In
some use cases, however, the condition for turning a scheme on and off
would depend on the system's situation.  For example, schemes for
proactive pages reclamation would need to be turned on when some memory
pressure is detected, and turned off when the system has enough free
memory.

For easier control of schemes activation based on the system situation,
this introduces a watermarks-based mechanism.  The client can describe
the watermark metric (e.g., amount of free memory in the system),
watermark check interval, and three watermarks, namely high, mid, and
low.  If the scheme is deactivated, it only gets the metric and compare
that to the three watermarks for every check interval.  If the metric is
higher than the high watermark, the scheme is deactivated.  If the
metric is between the mid watermark and the low watermark, the scheme is
activated.  If the metric is lower than the low watermark, the scheme is
deactivated again.  This is to allow users fall back to traditional
page-granularity mechanisms.

Subject: [PATCH 28/34] mm/damon: introduce DAMON-based Reclamation
 (DAMON_RECLAIM)

This implements a new kernel subsystem that finds cold memory regions
using DAMON and reclaims those immediately.  It is intended to be used
as proactive lightweigh reclamation logic for light memory pressure.
For heavy memory pressure, it could be inactivated and fall back to the
traditional page-scanning based reclamation.

It's implemented on top of DAMON framework to use the DAMON-based
Operation Schemes (DAMOS) feature.  It utilizes all the DAMOS features
including speed limit, prioritization, and watermarks.

It could be enabled and tuned in boot time via the kernel boot
parameter, and in run time via its module parameters
('/sys/module/damon_reclaim/parameters/') interface.

Subject: [PATCH 30/34] mm/damon/dbgfs: add adaptive_targets list check before
 enable monitor_on

When the ctx->adaptive_targets list is empty, I did some test on
monitor_on interface like this.

    # cat /sys/kernel/debug/damon/target_ids
    #
    # echo on > /sys/kernel/debug/damon/monitor_on
    # damon: kdamond (5390) starts

Though the ctx->adaptive_targets list is empty, but the kthread_run
still be called, and the kdamond.x thread still be created, this is
meaningless.

So there adds a judgment in 'dbgfs_monitor_on_write', if the
ctx->adaptive_targets list is empty, return -EINVAL.

Subject: [PATCH 31/34] mm/damon: simplify stop mechanism

A kernel thread can exit gracefully with kthread_stop().  So we don't
need a new flag 'kdamond_stop'.  And to make sure the task struct is not
freed when accessing it, get reference to it before termination.
