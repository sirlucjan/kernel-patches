Subject: [PATCH 01/33] btrfs: add a force_chunk_alloc to space_info's sysfs

In testing various things such as the btrfsck patch to detect over
allocation of chunks, empty block group deletion, and balance I've had
various ways to force chunk allocations for debug purposes.  Add a sysfs
file to enable forcing of chunk allocation for the owning space info in
order to enable us to add testcases in the future to test these various
features easier.

Subject: [PATCH 02/33] btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()

In case an inode was never logged since it was loaded from disk and was
modified in the current transaction (its ->last_trans matches the ID of
the current transaction), inode_logged() returns true even if there's no
existing log tree. In this case we can simply check if a log tree exists
and return false if it does not. This avoids a caller of inode_logged()
doing some unnecessary, but harmless, work.

For btrfs_log_new_name() it avoids it logging an inode in case it was
never logged since it was loaded from disk and there is currently no log
tree for the inode's root. For the remaining callers of inode_logged(),
btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log() and btrfs_del_inode_ref_in_log(), it has
no effect since they already check if a log tree exists through their
calls to join_running_log_trans().

So just add a check to inode_logged() to verify if a log tree exists, and
return false if it does not.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists
  btrfs: always update the logged transaction when logging new names
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when dropping inode items from log
  btrfs: add helper to truncate inode items when logging inode
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when truncating inode items from the log
  btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging inode if possible
  btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time
  btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file in full sync mode

This is patch 1/10 and test results are listed in the change log of the
last patch in the set.

Subject: [PATCH 03/33] btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log
 context

Since commit 75b463d2b47aef ("btrfs: do not commit logs and transactions
during link and rename operations"), we always pass a non-NULL log context
to btrfs_log_inode_parent() and therefore to all the functions that it
calls. So remove the checks we have all over the place that test for a
NULL log context, making the code shorter and easier to read, as well as
reducing the size of the generated code.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists

  btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging inode if possible
  btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time
  btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file in full sync mode

This is patch 2/10 and test results are listed in the change log of the

Subject: [PATCH 04/33] btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new
 name exists

When logging a new name for an inode, due to a link or rename operation,
we don't need to log all new dentries of the parent directories and their
subdirectories. We only want to log the names of the inode and that any
new parent directories exist. So in this case don't trigger logging of
the new dentries, that is only need when doing an explicit fsync on a
directory or on a file which requires logging its parent directories.

This avoids unnecessary work and reduces contention on the extent buffers
of a log tree.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists

  btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging inode if possible
  btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time
  btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file in full sync mode

Subject: [PATCH 05/33] btrfs: always update the logged transaction when
 logging new names

When we are logging a new name for an inode, due to a link or rename
operation, if the inode has ancestor inodes that are new, created in the
current transaction, we need to log that these inodes exist. To ensure
that a subsequent explicit fsync on one of these ancestor inodes does
sync the log, we don't set the logged_trans field of these inodes.
This was done in commit 75b463d2b47aef ("btrfs: do not commit logs and
transactions during link and rename operations"), to avoid syncing a
log after a rename or link operation.

In order to allow for future changes to do some optimizations, change
this behaviour to always update the logged_trans of any logged inode
and don't update the last_log_commit of the inode if we are logging
that it exists. This accomplishes that same objective with simpler
logic, allowing for some optimizations in the next patches.

So just do that simplification.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists

  btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging inode if possible
  btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time
  btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file in full sync mode

This is patch 4/10 and test results are listed in the change log of the
last patch in the set.

Subject: [PATCH 06/33] btrfs: avoid expensive search when dropping inode items
 from log

Whenever we are logging a directory inode, logging that an inode exists or
logging an inode that has changes in its references or xattrs, we attempt
to delete items of this inode we may have previously logged (through calls
to drop_objectid_items()).

That attempt does a btree search for deletion, which is expensive because
it always acquires write locks for extent buffers at levels 2, 1 and 0,
and it balances any node that is less than half full. Acquiring the write
locks can block the task if the extent buffers are already locked or block
other tasks attempting to lock them, which is specially bad in case of log
trees since they are small due to their short life, with a root node at a
level typically not greater than level 2.

If we know that we are logging the inode for the first time in the current
transaction, we can skip the search. This change does that.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists
  btrfs: always update the logged transaction when logging new names
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when dropping inode items from log
  btrfs: add helper to truncate inode items when logging inode
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when truncating inode items from the log
  btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging inode if possible
  btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time
  btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file in full sync mode

This is patch 5/10 and test results are listed in the change log of the
last patch in the set.

Subject: [PATCH 07/33] btrfs: add helper to truncate inode items when logging
 inode

Move the call to btrfs_truncate_inode_items(), and the surrounding retry
loop, into a local helper function. This avoids some repetition and avoids
making the next change a bit awkward due to a bit of too much indentation.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists
  btrfs: always update the logged transaction when logging new names
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when dropping inode items from log
  btrfs: add helper to truncate inode items when logging inode
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when truncating inode items from the log
  btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging inode if possible
  btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time
  btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file in full sync mode

This is patch 6/10 and test results are listed in the change log of the
last patch in the set.

Subject: [PATCH 08/33] btrfs: avoid expensive search when truncating inode
 items from the log

Whenever we are logging a file inode in full sync mode we call
btrfs_truncate_inode_items() to delete items of the inode we may have
previously logged.

That results in doing a btree search for deletion, which is expensive
because it always acquires write locks for extent buffers at levels 2, 1
and 0, and it balances any node that is less than half full. Acquiring
the write locks can block the task if the extent buffers are already
locked by another task or block other tasks attempting to lock them,
which is specially bad in case of log trees since they are small due to
their short life, with a root node at a level typically not greater than
level 2.

If we know that we are logging the inode for the first time in the current
transaction, we can skip the call to btrfs_truncate_inode_items(), avoiding
the deletion search. This change does that.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists
  btrfs: always update the logged transaction when logging new names
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when dropping inode items from log
  btrfs: add helper to truncate inode items when logging inode
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when truncating inode items from the log
  btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging inode if possible
  btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time
  btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file in full sync mode

This is patch 7/10 and test results are listed in the change log of the
last patch in the set.

Subject: [PATCH 09/33] btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode
 for the first time

When logging an extent, in the fast fsync path, we always attempt do drop
or trim any existing extents with a range that match or overlap the range
of the extent we are about to log. We do that through a call to
btrfs_drop_extents().

However this is not needed when we are logging the inode for the first
time in the current transaction, since we have no inode items of the
inode in the log tree. Calling btrfs_drop_extents() does a deletion search
on the log tree, which is expensive when we have concurrent tasks
accessing the log tree because a deletion search always acquires a write
lock on the extent buffers at levels 2, 1 and 0, adding significant lock
contention, specially taking into account the height of a log tree rarely
(if ever) goes beyond 2 or 3, due to its short life.

So skip the call to btrfs_drop_extents() when the inode was not previously
logged in the current transaction.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists
  btrfs: always update the logged transaction when logging new names
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when dropping inode items from log
  btrfs: add helper to truncate inode items when logging inode
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when truncating inode items from the log
  btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging inode if possible
  btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time
  btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file in full sync mode

This is patch 9/10 and test results are listed in the change log of the
last patch in the set.

Subject: [PATCH 10/33] btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging
 inode if possible

If we are logging that an inode exists and the inode was not logged
before, we can avoid searching in the log tree for the inode item since we
know it does not exists. That wastes time and adds more lock contention on
the extent buffers of the log tree when there are other tasks that are
logging other inodes.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists

Subject: [PATCH 11/33] btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file
 in full sync mode

When logging a regular file in full sync mode, we are currently committing
its delayed inode item. This is to ensure that we never miss copying the
inode item, with its most up to date data, into the log tree.

However that is not necessary since commit e4545de5b035 ("Btrfs: fix fsync
data loss after append write"), because even if we don't find the leaf
with the inode item when looking for leaves that changed in the current
transaction, we end up logging the inode item later using the in-memory
content. In case we find the leaf containing the inode item, we already
end up using the in-memory inode for filling the inode item in the log
tree, and not the inode item that is in the fs/subvolume tree, as it
might be not up to date (copy_items() -> fill_inode_item()).

So don't commit the delayed inode item, which brings a couple of benefits:

1) Avoid writing the inode item to the fs/subvolume btree, saving time and
   reducing lock contention on the btree;

2) In case no other item for the inode was changed, added or deleted in
   the same leaf where the inode item is located, we ended up copying
   all the items in that leaf to the log tree - it's harmless from a
   functional point of view, but it wastes time and log tree space.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists
  btrfs: always update the logged transaction when logging new names
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when dropping inode items from log
  btrfs: add helper to truncate inode items when logging inode
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when truncating inode items from the log
  btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging inode if possible
  btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time
  btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file in full sync mode

This is patch 10/10 and the following test results compare a branch with
the whole patch set applied versus a branch without any of the patches

The following script was used to test dbench with 8 and 16 jobs on a
machine with 12 cores, 64G of RAM, a NVME device and using a non-debug
kernel config (Debian's default):

  $ cat test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
      echo "Use $0 NUM_JOBS"
      exit 1

Subject: [PATCH 12/33] btrfs: remove root argument from btrfs_log_inode() and
 its callees

The root argument passed to btrfs_log_inode() is unncessary, as it is
always the root of the inode we are going to log. This root also gets
unnecessarily propagated to several functions called by btrfs_log_inode(),
and all of them take the inode as an argument as well. So just remove
the root argument from these functions and have them get the root from
the inode where needed.

This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following 5 patches:

  btrfs: remove root argument from btrfs_log_inode() and its callees
  btrfs: remove redundant log root assignment from log_dir_items()
  btrfs: factor out the copying loop of dir items from log_dir_items()
  btrfs: insert items in batches when logging a directory when possible
  btrfs: keep track of the last logged keys when logging a directory

This is patch 1/5. The change log of the last patch (5/5) has performance
results.

Subject: [PATCH 13/33] btrfs: remove redundant log root assignment from
 log_dir_items()

At log_dir_items() we are assigning the exact same value to the local
variable 'log', once when it's declared and once again shortly after.
Remove the later assignment as it's pointless.

This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following 5 patches:

  btrfs: remove root argument from btrfs_log_inode() and its callees
  btrfs: remove redundant log root assignment from log_dir_items()
  btrfs: factor out the copying loop of dir items from log_dir_items()
  btrfs: insert items in batches when logging a directory when possible
  btrfs: keep track of the last logged keys when logging a directory

This is patch 2/5. The change log of the last patch (5/5) has performance
results.

Subject: [PATCH 14/33] btrfs: factor out the copying loop of dir items from
 log_dir_items()

In preparation for the next change, move the loop that processes a leaf
and copies its directory items to the log, into a separate helper
function. This makes the next change simpler and it also helps making
log_dir_items() a bit shorter (specially after the next change).

This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following 5 patches:

  btrfs: remove root argument from btrfs_log_inode() and its callees
  btrfs: remove redundant log root assignment from log_dir_items()
  btrfs: factor out the copying loop of dir items from log_dir_items()
  btrfs: insert items in batches when logging a directory when possible
  btrfs: keep track of the last logged keys when logging a directory

This is patch 3/5. The change log of the last patch (5/5) has performance
results.

Subject: [PATCH 15/33] btrfs: insert items in batches when logging a directory
 when possible

When logging a directory, we scan its directory items from the subvolume
tree and then copy one by one into the log tree. This is not efficient
since we generally are able to insert several items in a batch, using a
single btree operation for adding several items at once. The reason we
copy items one by one is that we must check if each item was previously
logged in the current transaction, and if it was we either overwrite it
or skip it in case its content did not change in the subvolume tree (this
can happen only for dir item keys, but not for dir index keys), and doing
such check makes it a bit cumbersome to attempt batch insertions.

However the chances for doing batch insertions are very frequent and
always happen when:

1) Logging the directory for the first time in the current transaction,
   as none of the items exist in the log tree yet;

2) Logging new dir index keys, because the offset for new dir index keys
   comes from a monotonically increasing counter. This means if we keep
   adding dentries to a directory, through creation of new files and
   sub-directories or by adding new links or renaming from some other
   directory into the one we are logging, all the new dir index keys
   have a new offset that is greater than the offset of any previously
   logged index keys, so we can insert them in batches into the log tree.

For dir item keys, since their offset depends on the result of an hash
function against the dentry's name, unless the directory is being logged
for the first time in the current transaction, the chances being able to
insert the items in the log using batches is pretty much random and not
predictable, as it depends on the names of the dentries, but still happens
often enough.

So change directory logging to keep track of consecutive directory items
that don't exist yet in the log and batch insert them.

This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following 5 patches:

  btrfs: remove root argument from btrfs_log_inode() and its callees
  btrfs: remove redundant log root assignment from log_dir_items()
  btrfs: factor out the copying loop of dir items from log_dir_items()
  btrfs: insert items in batches when logging a directory when possible
  btrfs: keep track of the last logged keys when logging a directory

This is patch 4/5. The change log of the last patch (5/5) has performance
results.

Subject: [PATCH 16/33] btrfs: keep track of the last logged keys when logging
 a directory

After the first time we log a directory in the current transaction, for
each directory item in a changed leaf of the subvolume tree, we have to
check if we previously logged the item, in order to overwrite it in case
its data changed or skip it in case its data hasn't changed.

Checking if we have logged each item before not only wastes times, but it
also adds lock contention on the log tree. So in order to minimize the
number of times we do such checks, keep track of the offset of the last
key we logged for a directory and, on the next time we log the directory,
skip the checks for any new keys that have an offset greater than the
offset we have previously saved. This is specially effective for index
keys, because the offset for these keys comes from a monotonically
increasing counter.

This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following 5 patches:

  btrfs: remove root argument from btrfs_log_inode() and its callees
  btrfs: remove redundant log root assignment from log_dir_items()
  btrfs: factor out the copying loop of dir items from log_dir_items()
  btrfs: insert items in batches when logging a directory when possible
  btrfs: keep track of the last logged keys when logging a directory

This is patch 5/5.

The following test was used on a non-debug kernel to measure the impact
it has on a directory fsync:

  $ cat test-dir-fsync.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/nvme0n1
  MNT=/mnt/nvme0n1

  NUM_NEW_FILES=100000
  NUM_FILE_DELETES=1000

  mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
  mount -o ssd $DEV $MNT

  mkdir $MNT/testdir

  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_NEW_FILES; i++)); do
      echo -n > $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  # fsync the directory, this will log the new dir items and the inodes
  # they point to, because these are new inodes.
  start=$(date +%s%N)
  xfs_io -c "fsync" $MNT/testdir
  end=$(date +%s%N)

  dur=$(( (end - start) / 1000000 ))
  echo "dir fsync took $dur ms after adding $NUM_NEW_FILES files"

  # sync to force transaction commit and wipeout the log.
  sync

  del_inc=$(( $NUM_NEW_FILES / $NUM_FILE_DELETES ))
  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_NEW_FILES; i += $del_inc)); do
      rm -f $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  # fsync the directory, this will only log dir items, there are no
  # dentries pointing to new inodes.
  start=$(date +%s%N)
  xfs_io -c "fsync" $MNT/testdir
  end=$(date +%s%N)

  dur=$(( (end - start) / 1000000 ))
  echo "dir fsync took $dur ms after deleting $NUM_FILE_DELETES files"

  umount $MNT

Test results with NUM_NEW_FILES set to 100 000 and 1 000 000:

**** before patchset, 100 000 files, 1000 deletes ****

dir fsync took 848 ms after adding 100000 files
dir fsync took 175 ms after deleting 1000 files

**** after patchset, 100 000 files, 1000 deletes ****

dir fsync took 758 ms after adding 100000 files  (-11.2%)
dir fsync took 63 ms after deleting 1000 files   (-94.1%)

**** before patchset, 1 000 000 files, 1000 deletes ****

dir fsync took 9945 ms after adding 1000000 files
dir fsync took 473 ms after deleting 1000 files

**** after patchset, 1 000 000 files, 1000 deletes ****

dir fsync took 8677 ms after adding 1000000 files (-13.6%)
dir fsync took 146 ms after deleting 1000 files   (-105.6%)

Subject: [PATCH 17/33] btrfs: loop only once over data sizes array when
 inserting an item batch

When inserting a batch of items into a btree, we end up looping over the
data sizes array 3 times:

1) Once in the caller of btrfs_insert_empty_items(), when it populates the
   array with the data sizes for each item;

2) Once at btrfs_insert_empty_items() to sum the elements of the data
   sizes array and compute the total data size;

3) And then once again at setup_items_for_insert(), where we do exactly
   the same as what we do at btrfs_insert_empty_items(), to compute the
   total data size.

That is not bad for small arrays, but when the arrays have hundreds of
elements, the time spent on looping is not negligible. For example when
doing batch inserts of delayed items for dir index items or when logging
a directory, it's common to have 200 to 260 dir index items in a single
batch when using a leaf size of 16K and using file names between 8 and 12
characters. For a 64K leaf size, multiply that by 4. Taking into account
that during directory logging or when flushing delayed dir index items we
can have many of those large batches, the time spent on the looping adds
up quickly.

It's also more important to avoid it at setup_items_for_insert(), since
we are holding a write lock on a leaf and, in some cases, on upper nodes
of the btree, which causes us to block other tasks that want to access
the leaf and nodes for longer than necessary.

So change the code so that setup_items_for_insert() and
btrfs_insert_empty_items() no longer compute the total data size, and
instead rely on the caller to supply it. This makes us loop over the
array only once, where we can both populate the data size array and
compute the total data size, taking advantage of spatial and temporal
locality. To make this more manageable, use a structure to contain
all the relevant details for a batch of items (keys array, data sizes
array, total data size, number of items), and use it as an argument
for btrfs_insert_empty_items() and setup_items_for_insert().

This patch is part of a small patchset that is comprised of the following
patches:

  btrfs: loop only once over data sizes array when inserting an item batch
  btrfs: unexport setup_items_for_insert()
  btrfs: use single bulk copy operations when logging directories

This is patch 1/3 and performance results, and the specific tests, are
included in the changelog of patch 3/3.

From 4f21df012e82e035c291955fe238745c4c4f67e1 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

Subject: [PATCH 18/33] btrfs: unexport setup_items_for_insert()

Since setup_items_for_insert() is not used anymore outside of ctree.c,
make it static and remove its prototype from ctree.h. This also requires
to move the definition of setup_item_for_insert() from ctree.h to ctree.c
and move down btrfs_duplicate_item() so that it's defined after
setup_items_for_insert().

Further, since setup_item_for_insert() is used outside ctree.c, rename it
to btrfs_setup_item_for_insert().

This patch is part of a small patchset that is comprised of the following
patches:

  btrfs: loop only once over data sizes array when inserting an item batch
  btrfs: unexport setup_items_for_insert()
  btrfs: use single bulk copy operations when logging directories

This is patch 2/3 and performance results, and the specific tests, are
included in the changelog of patch 3/3.

From 95b9e4ec491101d38a6e7911766e0fca72353186 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001

Subject: [PATCH 19/33] btrfs: use single bulk copy operations when logging
 directories

When logging a directory and inserting a batch of directory items, we are
copying the data of each item from a leaf in the fs/subvolume tree to a
leaf in a log tree, separately. This is not really needed, since we are
copying from a contiguous memory area into another one, so we can use a
single copy operation to copy all items at once.

This patch is part of a small patchset that is comprised of the following
patches:

  btrfs: loop only once over data sizes array when inserting an item batch
  btrfs: unexport setup_items_for_insert()
  btrfs: use single bulk copy operations when logging directories

This is patch 3/3.

The following test was used to compare performance of a branch without the
patchset versus one branch that has the whole patchset applied:

  $ cat dir-fsync-test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/nvme0n1
  MNT=/mnt/nvme0n1

  NUM_NEW_FILES=1000000
  NUM_FILE_DELETES=1000
  LEAF_SIZE=16K

  mkfs.btrfs -f -n $LEAF_SIZE $DEV
  mount -o ssd $DEV $MNT

  mkdir $MNT/testdir

  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_NEW_FILES; i++)); do
      echo -n > $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  # Fsync the directory, this will log the new dir items and the inodes
  # they point to, because these are new inodes.
  start=$(date +%s%N)
  xfs_io -c "fsync" $MNT/testdir
  end=$(date +%s%N)

  dur=$(( (end - start) / 1000000 ))
  echo "dir fsync took $dur ms after adding $NUM_NEW_FILES files"

  # sync to force transaction commit and wipeout the log.
  sync

  del_inc=$(( $NUM_NEW_FILES / $NUM_FILE_DELETES ))
  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_NEW_FILES; i += $del_inc)); do
      rm -f $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  # Fsync the directory, this will only log dir items, there are no
  # dentries pointing to new inodes.
  start=$(date +%s%N)
  xfs_io -c "fsync" $MNT/testdir
  end=$(date +%s%N)

  dur=$(( (end - start) / 1000000 ))
  echo "dir fsync took $dur ms after deleting $NUM_FILE_DELETES files"

  umount $MNT

The tests were run on a non-debug kernel (Debian's default kernel config)
and were the following:

*** with a leaf size of 16K, before patchset ***

dir fsync took 8482 ms after adding 1000000 files
dir fsync took 166 ms after deleting 1000 files

*** with a leaf size of 16K, after patchset ***

dir fsync took 8196 ms after adding 1000000 files  (-3.4%)
dir fsync took 143 ms after deleting 1000 files    (-14.9%)

*** with a leaf size of 64K, before patchset ***

dir fsync took 12851 ms after adding 1000000 files
dir fsync took 466 ms after deleting 1000 files

*** with a leaf size of 64K, after  patchset ***

dir fsync took 12287 ms after adding 1000000 files (-4.5%)
dir fsync took 414 ms after deleting 1000 files    (-11.8%)

Subject: [PATCH 20/33] btrfs: index free space entries on size

Currently we index free space on offset only, because usually we have a
hint from the allocator that we want to honor for locality reasons.
However if we fail to use this hint we have to go back to a brute force
search through the free space entries to find a large enough extent.

With sufficiently fragmented free space this becomes quite expensive, as
we have to linearly search all of the free space entries to find if we
have a part that's long enough.

To fix this add a cached rb tree to index based on free space entry
bytes.  This will allow us to quickly look up the largest chunk in the
free space tree for this block group, and stop searching once we've
found an entry that is too small to satisfy our allocation.  We simply
choose to use this tree if we're searching from the beginning of the
block group, as we know we do not care about locality at that point.

I wrote an allocator test that creates a 10TiB ram backed null block
device and then fallocates random files until the file system is full.
I think go through and delete all of the odd files.  Then I spawn 8
threads that fallocate 64mib files (1/2 our extent size cap) until the
file system is full again.  I use bcc's funclatency to measure the
latency of find_free_extent.  The baseline results are

     nsecs               : count     distribution

avg = 623599 nsecs, total: 397259314759 nsecs, count: 637042

There's a little variation in the amount of calls done because of timing
of the threads with metadata requirements, but the avg, total, and
count's are relatively consistent between runs (usually within 2-5% of
each other).  As you can see here we have around a 30% decrease in
average latency with a 30% decrease in overall time spent in
find_free_extent.

Subject: [PATCH 21/33] btrfs: fix deadlock between chunk allocation and chunk
 btree modifications

When a task is doing some modification to the chunk btree and it is not in
the context of a chunk allocation or a chunk removal, it can deadlock with
another task that is currently allocating a new data or metadata chunk.

These contextes are the following:

* When relocating a system chunk, when we need to COW the extent buffers
  that belong to the chunk btree;

* When adding a new device (ioctl), where we need to add a new device item
  to the chunk btree;

* When removing a device (ioctl), where we need to remove a device item
  from the chunk btree;

* When resizing a device (ioctl), where we need to update a device item in
  the chunk btree and may need to relocate a system chunk that lies beyond
  the new device size when shrinking a device.

The problem happens due to a sequence of steps like the following:

1) Task A starts a data or metadata chunk allocation and it locks the
   chunk mutex;

2) Task B is relocating a system chunk, and when it needs to COW an extent
   buffer of the chunk btree, it has locked both that extent buffer as
   well as its parent extent buffer;

3) Since there is not enough available system space, either because none
   of the existing system block groups have enough free space or because
   the only one with enough free space is in RO mode due to the relocation,
   task B triggers a new system chunk allocation. It blocks when trying to
   acquire the chunk mutex, currently held by task A;

4) Task A enters btrfs_chunk_alloc_add_chunk_item(), in order to insert
   the new chunk item into the chunk btree and update the existing device
   items there. But in order to do that, it has to lock the extent buffer
   that task B locked at step 2, or its parent extent buffer, but task B
   is waiting on the chunk mutex, which is currently locked by task A,
   therefore resulting in a deadlock.

One example report when the deadlock happens with system chunk relocation:

So fix this by making sure that whenever we try to modify the chunk btree
and we are neither in a chunk allocation context nor in a chunk remove
context, we reserve system space before modifying the chunk btree.

Subject: [PATCH 22/33] btrfs: update comments for chunk allocation -ENOSPC
 cases

Update the comments at btrfs_chunk_alloc() and do_chunk_alloc() that
describe which cases can lead to a failure to allocate metadata and system
space despite having previously reserved space. This adds one more reason
that I previously forgot to mention.

Subject: [PATCH 23/33] btrfs: remove root argument from drop_one_dir_item()

The root argument for drop_one_dir_item() always matches the root of the
given directory inode, since each log tree is associated to one and only
one subvolume/root, so remove the argument.

Subject: [PATCH 27/33] btrfs: only copy dir index keys when logging a
 directory

Currently, when logging a directory, we copy both dir items and dir index
items from the fs/subvolume tree to the log tree. Both items have exactly
the same data (same struct btrfs_dir_item), the difference lies in the key
values, where a dir index key contains the index number of a directory
entry while the dir item key does not, as it's used for doing fast lookups
of an entry by name, while the former is used for sorting entries when
listing a directory.

We can exploit that and log only the dir index items, since they contain
all the information needed to correctly add, replace and delete directory
entries when replaying a log tree. Logging only the dir index items is
also backward and forward compatible: an unpatched kernel (without this
change) can correctly replay a log tree generated by a patched kernel
(with this patch), and a patched kernel can correctly replay a log tree
generated by an unpatched kernel.

The backward compatibility is ensured because:

1) For inserting a new dentry: a dentry is only inserted when we find a
   new dir index key - we can only insert if we know the dir index offset,
   which is encoded in the dir index key's offset;

2) For deleting dentries: during log replay, before adding or replacing
   dentries, we first replay dentry deletions. Whenever we find a dir item
   key or a dir index key in the subvolume/fs tree that is not logged in
   a range for which the log tree is authoritative, we do the unlink of
   the dentry, which removes both the existing dir item key and the dir
   index key. Therefore logging just dir index keys is enough to ensure
   dentry deletions are correctly replayed;

3) For dentry replacements: they work when we log only dir index keys
   and this is mostly due to a combination of 1) and 2). If we replace a
   dentry with name "foobar" to point from inode A to inode B, then we
   know the dir index key for the new dentry is different from the old
   one, as it has an index number (key offset) larger than the old one.
   This results in replaying a deletion, through replay_dir_deletes(),
   that causes the old dentry to be removed, both the dir item key and
   the dir index key, as mentioned at 2). Then when processing the new
   dir index key, we add the new dentry, adding both a new dir item key
   and a new index key pointing to inode B, as stated in 1).

The forward compatibility, the ability for a patched kernel to replay a
log created by an older, unpatched kernel, comes from the changes required
for making sure we are able to replay a log that only contains dir index
keys - we simply ignore every dir item key we find.

So modify directory logging to log only dir index items, and modify the
log replay process to ignore dir item keys, from log trees created by an
unpatched kernel, and process only with dir index keys. This reduces the
amount of logged metadata by about half, and therefore the time spent
logging or fsyncing large directories (less cpu time and less IO).

The following test script was used to measure this change:

   #!/bin/bash

   DEV=/dev/nvme0n1
   MNT=/mnt/nvme0n1

   NUM_NEW_FILES=1000000
   NUM_FILE_DELETES=10000

   mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
   mount -o ssd $DEV $MNT

   mkdir $MNT/testdir

   for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_NEW_FILES; i++)); do
           echo -n > $MNT/testdir/file_$i
   done

   start=$(date +%s%N)
   xfs_io -c "fsync" $MNT/testdir
   end=$(date +%s%N)

   dur=$(( (end - start) / 1000000 ))
   echo "dir fsync took $dur ms after adding $NUM_NEW_FILES files"

   # sync to force transaction commit and wipeout the log.
   sync

   del_inc=$(( $NUM_NEW_FILES / $NUM_FILE_DELETES ))
   for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_NEW_FILES; i += $del_inc)); do

Subject: [PATCH 28/33] btrfs: remove no longer needed logic for replaying
 directory deletes

Now that we log only dir index keys when logging a directory, we no longer
need to deal with dir item keys in the log replay code for replaying
directory deletes. This is also true for the case when we replay a log
tree created by a kernel that still logs dir items.

So remove the remaining code of the replay of directory deletes algorithm
that deals with dir item keys.

Subject: [PATCH 29/33] btrfs: only use ->max_extent_size if it is set in the
 bitmap

While adding self tests for my space index change I was hitting a
problem where the space indexed tree wasn't returning the expected
->max_extent_size.  This is because we will skip searching any entry
that doesn't have ->bytes >= the amount of bytes we want.  However we'll
still set the max_extent_size based on that entry.  The problem is if we
don't search the bitmap we won't have ->max_extent_size set properly, so
we can't really trust it.

This doesn't really result in a problem per-se, it can just result in us
not finding contiguous area that may exist.  Fix the max_extent_size
helper to return ->bytes if ->max_extent_size isn't set, and add a big
comment explaining why we're doing this.

Subject: [PATCH 31/33] btrfs: index free space entries on size

Currently we index free space on offset only, because usually we have a
hint from the allocator that we want to honor for locality reasons.
However if we fail to use this hint we have to go back to a brute force
search through the free space entries to find a large enough extent.

With sufficiently fragmented free space this becomes quite expensive, as
we have to linearly search all of the free space entries to find if we
have a part that's long enough.

To fix this add a cached rb tree to index based on free space entry
bytes.  This will allow us to quickly look up the largest chunk in the
free space tree for this block group, and stop searching once we've
found an entry that is too small to satisfy our allocation.  We simply
choose to use this tree if we're searching from the beginning of the
block group, as we know we do not care about locality at that point.

I wrote an allocator test that creates a 10TiB ram backed null block
device and then fallocates random files until the file system is full.
I think go through and delete all of the odd files.  Then I spawn 8
threads that fallocate 64mib files (1/2 our extent size cap) until the
file system is full again.  I use bcc's funclatency to measure the
latency of find_free_extent.  The baseline results are

avg = 623599 nsecs, total: 397259314759 nsecs, count: 637042

There's a little variation in the amount of calls done because of timing
of the threads with metadata requirements, but the avg, total, and
count's are relatively consistent between runs (usually within 2-5% of
each other).  As you can see here we have around a 30% decrease in
average latency with a 30% decrease in overall time spent in
find_free_extent.

Subject: [PATCH 33/33] btrfs: index free space entries on size

Currently we index free space on offset only, because usually we have a
hint from the allocator that we want to honor for locality reasons.
However if we fail to use this hint we have to go back to a brute force
search through the free space entries to find a large enough extent.

With sufficiently fragmented free space this becomes quite expensive, as
we have to linearly search all of the free space entries to find if we
have a part that's long enough.

To fix this add a cached rb tree to index based on free space entry
bytes.  This will allow us to quickly look up the largest chunk in the
free space tree for this block group, and stop searching once we've
found an entry that is too small to satisfy our allocation.  We simply
choose to use this tree if we're searching from the beginning of the
block group, as we know we do not care about locality at that point.

I wrote an allocator test that creates a 10TiB ram backed null block
device and then fallocates random files until the file system is full.
I think go through and delete all of the odd files.  Then I spawn 8
threads that fallocate 64mib files (1/2 our extent size cap) until the

There's a little variation in the amount of calls done because of timing
of the threads with metadata requirements, but the avg, total, and
count's are relatively consistent between runs (usually within 2-5% of
each other).  As you can see here we have around a 30% decrease in
average latency with a 30% decrease in overall time spent in
find_free_extent.
