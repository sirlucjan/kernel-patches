Subject: [PATCH 18/69] hwmon: (oxp-sensors) Add AYANEO AIR and AIR Pro

Add support for the AYANEO AIR and AYANEO AIR Pro models of handheld
devices. These devices use the same EC registers and logic as the One X
Player mini AMD. Previous AYANEO models are not supported as they use a
different EC and do not have the necessary fan speed write enable and
setting registers. The driver is tested on AYANEO AIR while AIR Pro model
EC functionality and DMI data were verified using command line tools by
another user.

Add:
- AYANEO AIR (AMD 5560U)
- AYANEO AIR Pro (AMD 5560U)
- AYANEO AIR Pro (AMD 5825U)

While at it, fix spelling error (appart -> apart).
