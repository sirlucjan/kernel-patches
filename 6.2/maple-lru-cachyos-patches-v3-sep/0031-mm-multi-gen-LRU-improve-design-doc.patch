Subject: [PATCH 31/40] mm: multi-gen LRU: improve design doc

This patch improves the design doc. Specifically,
  1. add a section for the per-memcg mm_struct list, and
  2. add a section for the PID controller.

+``mm_struct`` list
+------------------
+An ``mm_struct`` list is maintained for each memcg, and an
+``mm_struct`` follows its owner task to the new memcg when this task
+is migrated.
+
+A page table walker iterates ``lruvec_memcg()->mm_list`` and calls
+``walk_page_range()`` with each ``mm_struct`` on this list to scan
+PTEs. When multiple page table walkers iterate the same list, each of
+them gets a unique ``mm_struct``, and therefore they can run in
+parallel.
+
+Page table walkers ignore any misplaced pages, e.g., if an
+``mm_struct`` was migrated, pages left in the previous memcg will be
+ignored when the current memcg is under reclaim. Similarly, page table
+walkers will ignore pages from nodes other than the one under reclaim.
+
+This infrastructure also tracks the usage of ``mm_struct`` between
+context switches so that page table walkers can skip processes that
+have been sleeping since the last iteration.
