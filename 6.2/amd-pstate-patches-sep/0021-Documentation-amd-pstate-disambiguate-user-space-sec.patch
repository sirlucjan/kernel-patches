Subject: [PATCH 21/21] Documentation: amd-pstate: disambiguate user space
 sections

kernel test robot reported htmldocs warning:

Documentation/admin-guide/pm/amd-pstate.rst:343: WARNING: duplicate label admin-guide/pm/amd-pstate:user space interface in ``sysfs``, other instance in Documentation/admin-guide/pm/amd-pstate.rst

The documentation contains two sections with the same "User Space Interface
in ``sysfs``" title. The first one deals with per-policy sysfs and the
second one is about general attributes (currently only global attributes
are documented).

Disambiguate title text of both sections to fix the warning.
