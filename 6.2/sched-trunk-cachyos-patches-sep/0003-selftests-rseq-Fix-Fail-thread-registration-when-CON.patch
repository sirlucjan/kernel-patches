Subject: [PATCH 003/113] selftests/rseq: Fix: Fail thread registration when
 CONFIG_RSEQ=n

When linking the selftests against a libc which does not handle rseq
registration (before 2.35),  rseq thread registration silently succeed
even with CONFIG_RSEQ=n because it erroneously thinks that libc is
handling rseq registration.

This is caused by setting the rseq ownership flag only after the
rseq_available() check. It should rather be set before the
rseq_available() check.

Set the rseq_size to 0 (error value) immediately after the
rseq_available() check fails rather than in the thread registration
functions.
