Subject: [PATCH 26/66] hwmon: (emc2305) fix kernel-doc warnings

Fix kernel-doc warnings:
drivers/hwmon/emc2305.c:62: warning: Cannot understand  * @cdev: cooling device;
 on line 62 - I thought it was a doc line
drivers/hwmon/emc2305.c:89: warning: Cannot understand  * @client: i2c client;
 on line 89 - I thought it was a doc line

and drop ';' at end of each struct member line.
