Subject: [PATCH 11/23] ext4: update s_journal_inum if it changes after journal
 replay
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When mounting a crafted ext4 image, s_journal_inum may change after journal
replay, which is obviously unreasonable because we have successfully loaded
and replayed the journal through the old s_journal_inum. And the new
s_journal_inum bypasses some of the checks in ext4_get_journal(), which
may trigger a null pointer dereference problem. So if s_journal_inum
changes after the journal replay, we ignore the change, and rewrite the
current journal_inum to the superblock.
