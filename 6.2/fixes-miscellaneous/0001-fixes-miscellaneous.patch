Subject: [PATCH 02/30] ZEN: mm: Lower the non-hugetlbpage pageblock size to
 reduce scheduling delays

The page allocator processes free pages in groups of pageblocks, where
the size of a pageblock is typically quite large (1024 pages without
hugetlbpage support). Pageblocks are processed atomically with the zone
lock held, which can cause severe scheduling delays on both the CPU
going through the pageblock and any other CPUs waiting to acquire the
zone lock. A frequent offender is move_freepages_block(), which is used
by rmqueue() for page allocation.

As it turns out, there's no requirement for pageblocks to be so large,
so the pageblock order can simply be reduced to ease the scheduling
delays and zone lock contention. PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER is used as a
reasonable setting to ensure non-costly page allocation requests can
still be serviced without always needing to free up more than one
pageblock's worth of pages at a time.

This has a noticeable effect on overall system latency when memory
pressure is elevated. The various mm functions which operate on
pageblocks no longer appear in the preemptoff tracer, where previously
they would spend up to 100 ms on a mobile arm64 CPU processing a
pageblock with preemption disabled and the zone lock held.

+ * DOC: Overview
+ *
+ * The ``blkdev`` LED trigger works by periodically checking the activity
+ * counters of block devices that have been linked to one or more LEDs and
+ * blinking those LED(s) if the correct type of activity has occurred.  The
+ * periodic check is scheduled with the Linux kernel's deferred work facility.
+ *
+ * Trigger-specific data about block devices and LEDs is stored in two data
+ * structures --- &struct blkdev_trig_bdev (a "BTB") and &struct blkdev_trig_led
+ * (a "BTL").  Each structure contains a &struct xarray that holds links to any
+ * linked devices of the other type.  I.e. &blkdev_trig_bdev.linked_btls
+ * contains links to all BTLs whose LEDs have been linked to the BTB's block
+ * device, and &blkdev_trig_led.linked_btbs contains links to all BTBs whose
+ * block devices have been linked to the BTL's LED.  Thus, a block device can
+ * be linked to more than one LED, and an LED can be linked to more than one
+ * block device.

+=================================
+Block Device (blkdev) LED Trigger
+=================================
+
+Available when ``CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV=y`` or
+``CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV=m``.
+
+See also:
+
+* ``Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-trigger-blkdev``
+* ``Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-block`` (``/sys/block/<disk>/linked_leds``)
+
+Overview
+========
+
+.. note::
+	The examples below use ``<LED>`` to refer to the name of a
+	system-specific LED.  If no suitable LED is available on a test
+	system (in a virtual machine, for example), it is possible to
+	use a userspace LED.  (See ``Documentation/leds/uleds.rst``.)
+
+Verify that the ``blkdev`` LED trigger is available::
+
+	# grep blkdev /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
+	... rfkill-none blkdev
+
+(If the previous command produces no output, you may need to load the trigger
+module - ``modprobe ledtrig_blkdev``.  If the module is not available, check
+the value of ``CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV`` in your kernel configuration.)
+
+Associate the LED with the ``blkdev`` LED trigger::
+
+	# echo blkdev > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
+
+	# cat /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
+	... rfkill-none [blkdev]
+
+Note that several new device attributes are available in the
+``/sys/class/leds/<LED>`` directory.
+
+* ``link_dev_by_path``, ``unlink_dev_by_path``, and ``unlink_dev_by_name`` are
+  used to manage the set of block devices associated with this LED.  The LED
+  will blink when activity occurs on any of its linked devices.
+
+* ``blink_on_read``, ``blink_on_write``, ``blink_on_discard``, and
+  ``blink_on_flush`` are boolean values that determine whether the LED will
+  blink when a particular type of activity is detected on one of its linked
+  block devices.
+
+* ``blink_time`` is the duration (in milliseconds) of each blink of this LED.
+  (The minimum value is 10 milliseconds.)
+
+* ``check_interval`` is the frequency (in milliseconds) with which block devices
+  linked to this LED will be checked for activity and the LED blinked (if the
+  correct type of activity has occurred).
+
+* The ``linked_devices`` directory will contain a symbolic link to every device
+  that is associated with this LED.
+
+Link a block device to the LED::
+
+	# echo /dev/sda > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/link_dev_by_path
+
+	# ls /sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices
+	sda
+
+(The value written to ``link_dev_by_path`` must be the path of the device
+special file, such as ``/dev/sda``, that represents the block device - or the
+path of a symbolic link to such a device special file.)
+
+Activity on the device will now cause the LED to blink.  The duration of each
+blink (in milliseconds) can be adjusted by setting
+``/sys/class/leds/<LED>/blink_time``.  (But see **check_interval and
+blink_time** below.)
+
+Associate a second device with the LED::
+
+	# echo /dev/sdb > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/link_dev_by_path
+
+	# ls /sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices
+	sda  sdb
+
+When a block device is linked to one or more LEDs, the LEDs are linked from
+the device's ``linked_leds`` directory::
+
+	# ls /sys/class/block/sd{a,b}/linked_leds
+	/sys/class/block/sda/linked_leds:
+	<LED>
+
+	/sys/class/block/sdb/linked_leds:
+	<LED>
+
+(The ``linked_leds`` directory only exists when the block device is linked to
+at least one LED.)
+
+``check_interval`` and ``blink_time``
+=====================================
+
+* By default, linked block devices are checked for activity every 100
+  milliseconds.  This frequency can be changed for an LED via the
+  ``/sys/class/leds/<led>/check_interval`` attribute.  (The minimum value is 25
+  milliseconds.)
+
+* All block devices associated with an LED are checked for activity every
+  ``check_interval`` milliseconds, and a blink is triggered if the correct type
+  of activity (as determined by the LED's ``blink_on_*`` attributes) is
+  detected.  The duration of an LED's blink is determined by its ``blink_time``
+  attribute.  Thus (when the correct type of activity is detected), the LED will
+  be on for ``blink_time`` milliseconds and off for
+  ``check_interval - blink_time`` milliseconds.
+
+* The LED subsystem ignores new blink requests for an LED that is already in
+  in the process of blinking, so setting a ``blink_time`` greater than or equal
+  to ``check_interval`` will cause some blinks to be missed.
+
+* Because of processing times, scheduling latencies, etc., avoiding missed
+  blinks actually requires a difference of at least a few milliseconds between
+  the ``blink_time`` and ``check_interval``.  The required difference is likely
+  to vary from system to system.  As a  reference, a Thecus N5550 NAS requires a
+  difference of 7 milliseconds (e.g. ``check_interval == 100``,
+  ``blink_time == 93``).
+
+* The default values (``check_interval == 100``, ``blink_time == 75``) cause the
+  LED associated with a continuously active device to blink rapidly.  For a more
+  "always on" effect, increase the ``blink_time`` (but not too much; see the
+  previous bullet).
+
+Other Notes
+===========
+
+* Many (possibly all) types of block devices work with this trigger, including:
+
+  * SCSI (including SATA and USB) hard disk drives and SSDs
+  * SCSI (including SATA and USB) optical drives
+  * NVMe SSDs
+  * SD cards
+  * loopback block devices (``/dev/loop*``)
+  * device mapper devices, such as LVM logical volumes
+  * MD RAID devices
+  * zRAM compressed RAM-disks
+  * partitions on block devices that support them
+
+* The names of the symbolic links in ``/sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices``
+  are **kernel** names, which may not match the paths used for
+  ``link_dev_by_path`` and ``unlink_dev_by_path``.  This is most likely when a
+  symbolic link is used to refer to the device (as is common with logical
+  volumes), but it can be true for any device, because nothing prevents the
+  creation of device special files with arbitrary names (e.g.
+  ``sudo mknod /foo b 8 0``).
+
+  Kernel names can be used to unlink block devices from LEDs by writing them to
+  the LED's ``unlink_dev_by_name`` attribute.
+
+* The ``blkdev`` LED trigger supports many-to-many device/LED associations.
+  A device can be associated with multiple LEDs, and an LED can be associated
+  with multiple devices.

Subject: [PATCH 05/30] kbuild: revive parallel execution for
 .tmp_initcalls.lds rule

Prior to commit 5d45950dfbb1 ("kbuild: move vmlinux.o link to
scripts/Makefile.vmlinux_o"), jobserver-exec was invoked from the shell
script, link-vmlinux.sh. It can get access to the jobserver because
Makefile adds '+' prefix, as in:

    +$(call if_changed_dep,link_vmlinux)

Since 5d45950dfbb1, jobserver-exec is invoked from Makefile, but the
'+' prefix is missing, hence jobserver-exec has no access to the
jobserver.

Subject: [PATCH 06/30] padata: Do not mark padata_mt_helper() as __init

When building arm64 allmodconfig + ThinLTO with clang and a proposed
modpost update to account for -ffuncton-sections, the following warning
appears:

  WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o: section mismatch in reference: padata_work_init (section: .text.padata_work_init) -> padata_mt_helper (section: .init.text)
  WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o: section mismatch in reference: padata_work_init (section: .text.padata_work_init) -> padata_mt_helper (section: .init.text)

In both cases, an __init function calls padata_work_init(), which is not
marked __init, with padata_mt_helper(), another __init function, as a
work function argument.

padata_work_init() is called from non-init paths, otherwise it could be
marked __init to resolve the warning. Instead, remove __init from
padata_mt_helper() to resolve the warning.

Subject: [PATCH 10/30] objtool: Install libsubcmd in build

Including from tools/lib can create inadvertent dependencies. Install
libsubcmd in the objtool build and then include the headers from
there.

Subject: [PATCH 12/30] objtool: Alter how HOSTCC is forced

HOSTCC is always wanted when building objtool. Setting CC to HOSTCC
happens after tools/scripts/Makefile.include is included, meaning
flags are set assuming say CC is gcc, but then it can be later set to
HOSTCC which may be clang. tools/scripts/Makefile.include is needed
for host set up and common macros in objtool's Makefile. Rather than
override CC to HOSTCC, just pass CC as HOSTCC to Makefile.build, the
libsubcmd builds and the linkage step. This means the Makefiles don't
see things like CC changing and tool flag determination, and similar,
work properly. To avoid mixing CFLAGS from different compilers just
the objtool CFLAGS are determined with the exception of
EXTRA_WARNINGS. HOSTCFLAGS is added to these so that command line
flags can add to the CFLAGS.

Subject: [PATCH 13/30] mm: remove PageMovable export

The only in-kernel users that need PageMovable() to be exported are
z3fold and zsmalloc and they are only using it for dubious debugging
functionality.  So remove those usages and the export so that no driver
code accidentally thinks that they are allowed to use this symbol.

Subject: [PATCH 15/30] bitmap: switch from inline to __always_inline

'inline' keyword is only a recommendation for compiler. If it decides to
not inline bitmap, find_bit, cpumask or nodemask functions, the whole
small_const_nbits() machinery doesn't work.

This is how a standard GCC 11.3.0 does for my x86_64 build now. This patch
replaces 'inline' directive with unconditional '__always_inline' to make
sure that there's always a chance for compile-time optimization. It doesn't
change size of kernel image, according to bloat-o-meter.

Subject: [PATCH 16/30] x86/acpi/boot: Do not register processors that cannot
 be onlined for x2APIC

Section 5.2.12.12 Processor Local x2APIC Structure in the ACPI v6.5
spec mandates that both "enabled" and "online capable" Local APIC Flags
should be used to determine if the processor is usable or not.

However, Linux doesn't use the "online capable" flag for x2APIC to
determine if the processor is usable. As a result, cpu_possible_mask has
incorrect value and results in more memory getting allocated for per_cpu
variables than it is going to be used.

Make sure Linux parses both "enabled" and "online capable" flags for
x2APIC to correctly determine if the processor is usable.

The rescan field was not well named albeit accurate at the time. Rename the
field to finish_pageblock to indicate that the remainder of the pageblock
should be scanned regardless of COMPACT_CLUSTER_MAX. The intent is that
pageblocks with transient failures get marked for skipping to avoid
revisiting the same pageblock.

Subject: [PATCH 21/30] mm, compaction: Finish pageblocks on complete migration
 failure

Commit 7efc3b726103 ("mm/compaction: fix set skip in
fast_find_migrateblock") address an issue where a pageblock selected
by fast_find_migrateblock() was ignored. Unfortunately, the same fix
resulted in numerous reports of khugepaged or kcompactd stalling for
long periods of time or consuming 100% of CPU.

Tracing showed that there was a lot of rescanning between a small subset
of pageblocks because the conditions for marking the block skip are not
met. The scan is not reaching the end of the pageblock because enough
pages were isolated but none were migrated successfully. Eventually it
circles back to the same block.

Pageblock skip tracking tries to minimise both latency and excessive
scanning but tracking exactly when a block is fully scanned requires an
excessive amount of state. This patch forcibly rescans a pageblock when
all isolated pages fail to migrate even though it could be for transient
reasons such as page writeback or page dirty. This will sometimes migrate
too many pages but pageblocks will be marked skip and forward progress
will be made.

"Usemen" from the mmtests configuration
workload-usemem-stress-numa-compact was used to stress compaction.
The compaction trace events were recorded using a 6.2-rc5 kernel that
includes commit 7efc3b726103 and count of unique ranges were measured. The
top 5 ranges were

   3076 range=(0x10ca00-0x10cc00)
   3076 range=(0x110a00-0x110c00)
   3098 range=(0x13b600-0x13b800)
   3104 range=(0x141c00-0x141e00)
  11424 range=(0x11b600-0x11b800)

While this workload is very different than what the bugs reported,
the pattern of the same subset of blocks being repeatedly scanned is
observed. At one point, *only* the range range=(0x11b600 ~ 0x11b800)
was scanned for 2 seconds. 14 seconds passed between the first
migration-related event and the last.

With the series applied including this patch, the top 5 ranges were

      1 range=(0x11607e-0x116200)
      1 range=(0x116200-0x116278)
      1 range=(0x116278-0x116400)
      1 range=(0x116400-0x116424)
      1 range=(0x116424-0x116600)

Only unique ranges were scanned and the time between the first
migration-related event was 0.11 milliseconds.

Subject: [PATCH 23/30] x86/cpu: Use cpu_feature_enabled() when checking global
 pages support

X86_FEATURE_PGE determines whether the CPU has enabled global page
translations support. Use the faster cpu_feature_enabled() check to
shave off some more cycles when flushing all TLB entries, including the
global ones.

What this practically saves is:

   mov    0x82eb308(%rip),%rax        # 0xffffffff8935bec8 <boot_cpu_data+40>
   test   $0x20,%ah

... which test the bit. Not a lot, but TLB flushing is a timing-sensitive
path, so anything to make it even faster.

No functional changes.

Subject: [PATCH 24/30] ACPI: Don't build ACPICA with '-Os'

The ACPICA code has been built with '-Os' since the beginning of git
history, though there's no explanatory comment as to why.

This is unfortunate as GCC drops the alignment specificed by
'-falign-functions=N' when '-Os' is used, as reported in GCC bug 88345:

  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=88345

This prevents CONFIG_FUNCTION_ALIGNMENT and
CONFIG_DEBUG_FORCE_FUNCTION_ALIGN_64B from having their expected effect
on the ACPICA code. This is doubly unfortunate as in subsequent patches
arm64 will depend upon CONFIG_FUNCTION_ALIGNMENT for its ftrace
implementation.

Drop the '-Os' flag when building the ACPICA code. With this removed,
the code builds cleanly and works correctly in testing so far.

I've tested this by selecting CONFIG_DEBUG_FORCE_FUNCTION_ALIGN_64B=y,
building and booting a kernel using ACPI, and looking for misaligned
text symbols:

* arm64:

  Before, v6.2-rc3:
    # uname -rm
    6.2.0-rc3 aarch64
    # grep ' [Tt] ' /proc/kallsyms | grep -iv '[048c]0 [Tt] ' | wc -l
    5009

  Before, v6.2-rc3 + fixed __cold:
    # uname -rm
    6.2.0-rc3-00001-g2a2bedf8bfa9 aarch64
    # grep ' [Tt] ' /proc/kallsyms | grep -iv '[048c]0 [Tt] ' | wc -l
    919

  After:
    # uname -rm
    6.2.0-rc3-00002-g267bddc38572 aarch64
    # grep ' [Tt] ' /proc/kallsyms | grep -iv '[048c]0 [Tt] ' | wc -l
    323
    # grep ' [Tt] ' /proc/kallsyms | grep -iv '[048c]0 [Tt] ' | grep acpi | wc -l
    0

* x86_64:

  Before, v6.2-rc3:
    # uname -rm
    6.2.0-rc3 x86_64
    # grep ' [Tt] ' /proc/kallsyms | grep -iv '[048c]0 [Tt] ' | wc -l
    11537

  Before, v6.2-rc3 + fixed __cold:
    # uname -rm
    6.2.0-rc3-00001-g2a2bedf8bfa9 x86_64
    # grep ' [Tt] ' /proc/kallsyms | grep -iv '[048c]0 [Tt] ' | wc -l
    2805

  After:
    # uname -rm
    6.2.0-rc3-00002-g267bddc38572 x86_64
    # grep ' [Tt] ' /proc/kallsyms | grep -iv '[048c]0 [Tt] ' | wc -l
    1357
    # grep ' [Tt] ' /proc/kallsyms | grep -iv '[048c]0 [Tt] ' | grep acpi | wc -l
    0

With the patch applied, the remaining unaligned text labels are a
combination of static call trampolines and labels in assembly, which can
be dealt with in subsequent patches.

When we are renaming a directory to a different directory, we need to
update '..' entry in the moved directory. However nothing prevents moved
directory from being modified and even converted from the inline format
to the normal format. When such race happens the rename code gets
confused and we crash. Fix the problem by locking the moved directory.

as-option tests new options using KBUILD_CFLAGS, which causes problems

options are not valid assembler options.

This will be fixed in a follow up patch. Before doing so, move the
assembler test for -Wa,-mrelax-relocations=no from using as-option to
cc-option.

Subject: [PATCH 30/30] kbuild: Update assembler calls to use proper flags and
 language target

as-instr uses KBUILD_AFLAGS, but as-option uses KBUILD_CFLAGS. This can
cause as-option to fail unexpectedly when CONFIG_WERROR is set, because
clang will emit -Werror,-Wunused-command-line-argument for various -m
and -f flags in KBUILD_CFLAGS for assembler sources.

Callers of as-option and as-instr should be adding flags to
KBUILD_AFLAGS / aflags-y, not KBUILD_CFLAGS / cflags-y. Use
KBUILD_AFLAGS in all macros to clear up the initial problem.

Unfortunately, -Wunused-command-line-argument can still be triggered
with clang by the presence of warning flags or macro definitions because
'-x assembler' is used, instead of '-x assembler-with-cpp', which will
consume these flags. Switch to '-x assembler-with-cpp' in places where
'-x assembler' is used, as the compiler is always used as the driver for
out of line assembler sources in the kernel.

Finally, add -Werror to these macros so that they behave consistently
whether or not CONFIG_WERROR is set.

[nathan: Reworded and expanded on problems in commit message
         Use '-x assembler-with-cpp' in a couple more places]
