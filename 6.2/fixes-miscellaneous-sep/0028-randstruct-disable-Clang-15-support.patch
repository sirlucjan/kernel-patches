Subject: [PATCH 28/30] randstruct: disable Clang 15 support

The randstruct support released in Clang 15 is unsafe to use due to a
bug that can cause miscompilations: "-frandomize-layout-seed
inconsistently randomizes all-function-pointers structs"
(https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/60349).  It has been fixed
on the Clang 16 release branch, so add a Clang version check.

Fixes: 035f7f87b729 ("randstruct: Enable Clang support")
