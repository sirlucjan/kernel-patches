Subject: [PATCH 010/112] btrfs: fix uninitialized variable warning in
 btrfs_sb_log_location

We only have 3 possible mirrors, and we have ASSERT()'s to make sure
we're not passing in an invalid super mirror into this function, so
technically this value isn't uninitialized.  However
-Wmaybe-uninitialized will complain, so set it to U64_MAX so if we don't
have ASSERT()'s turned on it'll error out later on when it see's the
zone is beyond our maximum zones.
