Subject: [PATCH 36/36] btrfs: scrub: avoid crash if scrub is trying to do
 recovery for a removed block group

[BUG]
Syzbot reported an ASSERT() got triggered during a scrub repair along
with balance:

[CAUSE]
Btrfs can delete empty block groups either through auto-cleanup or
relcation.

Scrub normally is able to handle this situation well by doing extra
checking, and holding the block group cache pointer during the whole
scrub lifespan.

But unfortunately for lock_full_stripe() and unlock_full_stripe()
functions, due to the context restriction, they have to do an extra
search on the block group cache.
(While the main scrub threads holds a proper btrfs_block_group, but we
have no way to directly use that in repair context).

Thus it can happen that the target block group is already deleted by
relocation.

In that case, we trigger the above ASSERT().

[FIX]
Instead of triggering the ASSERT(), let's just return 0 and continue,
this would leave @locked_ret to be false, and we won't try to unlock
later.
