Subject: [PATCH 34/41] arm64: mm: pass original fault address to
 handle_mm_fault() in PER_VMA_LOCK block

When reading the arm64's PER_VMA_LOCK support code, I found a bit
difference between arm64 and other arch when calling handle_mm_fault()
during VMA lock-based page fault handling: the fault address is masked
before passing to handle_mm_fault(). This is also different from the
usage in mmap_lock-based handling. I think we need to pass the
original fault address to handle_mm_fault() as we did in
commit 84c5e23edecd ("arm64: mm: Pass original fault address to
handle_mm_fault()").

If we go through the code path further, we can find that the "masked"
fault address can cause mismatched fault address between perf sw
major/minor page fault sw event and perf page fault sw event:

do_page_fault
  perf_sw_event(PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS, ..., addr)   // orig addr
  handle_mm_fault
    mm_account_fault
      perf_sw_event(PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS_MAJ, ...) // masked addr
