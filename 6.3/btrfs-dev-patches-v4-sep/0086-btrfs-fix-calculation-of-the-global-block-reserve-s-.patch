Subject: [PATCH 086/145] btrfs: fix calculation of the global block reserve's
 size

At btrfs_update_global_block_rsv(), we are assuming an unlink operation
uses 5 metadata units, but that's not true anymore, it uses 6 since the
commit bca4ad7c0b54 ("btrfs: reserve correct number of items for unlink
and rmdir"). So update the code and comments to consider 6 units.
