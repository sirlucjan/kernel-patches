Subject: [PATCH 119/145] btrfs: warn for any missed cleanup at
 btrfs_close_one_device

During my recent search for the root cause of a reported bug, I realized
that it's a good idea to issue a warning for missed cleanup instead of
using debug-only assertions. Since most installations run with debug off,
missed cleanups and premature calls to close could go unnoticed. However,
these issues are serious enough to warrant reporting and fixing.
