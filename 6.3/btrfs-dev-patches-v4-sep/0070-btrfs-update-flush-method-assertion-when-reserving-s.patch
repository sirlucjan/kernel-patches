Subject: [PATCH 070/145] btrfs: update flush method assertion when reserving
 space

When reserving space, at space-info.c:__reserve_bytes(), we assert that
either the current task is not holding a transacion handle, or, if it is,
that the flush method is not BTRFS_RESERVE_FLUSH_ALL. This is because that
flush method can trigger transaction commits, and therefore could lead to
a deadlock.

However there are other 2 flush methods that can trigger transaction
commits:

1) BTRFS_RESERVE_FLUSH_ALL_STEAL
2) BTRFS_RESERVE_FLUSH_EVICT

So update the assertion to check the flush method is also not one those
two methods if the current task is holding a transaction handle.
