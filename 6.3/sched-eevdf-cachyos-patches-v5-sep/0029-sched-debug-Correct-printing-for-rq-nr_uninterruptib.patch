Subject: [PATCH 29/50] sched/debug: Correct printing for
 rq->nr_uninterruptible

Commit e6fe3f422be1 ("sched: Make multiple runqueue task counters
32-bit") changed the type for rq->nr_uninterruptible from "unsigned
long" to "unsigned int", but left wrong cast print to
/sys/kernel/debug/sched/debug and to the console.

For example, nr_uninterruptible's value is fffffff7 with type
"unsigned int", (long)nr_uninterruptible shows 4294967287 while
(int)nr_uninterruptible prints -9. So using int cast fixes wrong
printing.
