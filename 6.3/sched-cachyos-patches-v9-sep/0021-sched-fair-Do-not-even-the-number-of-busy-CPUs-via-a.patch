Subject: [PATCH 21/36] sched/fair: Do not even the number of busy CPUs via
 asym_packing

Now that find_busiest_group() triggers load balancing between a fully_
busy SMT2 core and an idle non-SMT core, it is no longer needed to force
balancing via asym_packing. Use asym_packing only as intended: when there
is high-priority CPU that is idle.

After this change, the same logic apply to SMT and non-SMT local groups.
It makes less sense having a separate function to deal specifically with
SMT. Fold the logic in asym_smt_can_pull_tasks() into sched_asym().
