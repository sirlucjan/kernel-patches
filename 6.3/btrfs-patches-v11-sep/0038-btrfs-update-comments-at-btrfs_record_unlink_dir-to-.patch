Subject: [PATCH 38/40] btrfs: update comments at btrfs_record_unlink_dir() to
 be more clear

Update the comments at btrfs_record_unlink_dir() so that they mention
where new names are logged and where old names are removed. Also, while
at it make the width of the comments closer to 80 columns and capitalize
the sentences and finish them with punctuation.
