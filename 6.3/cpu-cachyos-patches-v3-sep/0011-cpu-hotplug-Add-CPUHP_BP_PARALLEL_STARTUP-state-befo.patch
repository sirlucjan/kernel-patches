Subject: [PATCH 11/18] cpu/hotplug: Add CPUHP_BP_PARALLEL_STARTUP state before
 CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU

There is often significant latency in the early stages of CPU bringup,
and time is wasted by waking each CPU (e.g. with SIPI/INIT/INIT on x86)
and then waiting for it to make its way through hardware powerup and
through firmware before finally reaching the kernel entry point and
moving on through its startup.

Allow a platform to register a pre-bringup CPUHP state to which each
CPU can be stepped in parallel, thus absorbing some of that latency.

There is a subtlety here: even with an empty CPUHP_BP_PARALLEL_STARTUP
step, this means that *all* CPUs are brought through the prepare states
all the way to CPUHP_BP_PARALLEL_STARTUP before any of them are taken
to CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU and then are allowed to run for themselves to
CPUHP_ONLINE.

So any combination of prepare/start calls which depend on A-B ordering
for each CPU in turn would explore horribly. As an example, the X2APIC
code prior to commit cefad862f238 ("x86/apic/x2apic: Allow CPU
cluster_mask to be populated in parallel") would allocate a new cluster
mask "just in case" and store it in a global variable in the prep stage,
then the AP would potentially consume that preallocated structure and set
the global pointer to NULL to be reallocated in CPUHP_X2APIC_PREPARE for
the next CPU. Which doesn't work at all if the prepare step is run for
all the CPUs first.

Any platform enabling the CPUHP_BP_PARALLEL_STARTUP step must be
reviewed and tested to ensure that such issues do not exist, and the
existing behaviour of each AP through to CPUHP_BP_PREPARE_DYN and then
immediately to CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU and CPUHP_ONLINE only one at a time
does not change unless such a state is registered.

Note that this does *not* yet bring each AP to the CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU
state at the same time, only to the new CPUHP_BP_PARALLEL_STARTUP state.
The final loop in bringup_nonboot_cpus() remains the same, bringing each
AP in turn from the CPUHP_BP_PARALLEL_STARTUP (or all the way from
CPUHP_OFFLINE) to CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU and then waiting for that AP to do
its own processing and reach CPUHP_ONLINE before releasing the next.

Parallelising that part by bringing them all to CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU and
then waiting for them all to run to CPUHP_ONLINE at the same time is a
more complicated exercise for the future.
