Subject: [PATCH 7/7] xfs: fix double xfs_perag_rele() in
 xfs_filestream_pick_ag()

xfs_bmap_longest_free_extent() can return an error when accessing
the AGF fails. In this case, the behaviour of
xfs_filestream_pick_ag() is conditional on the error. We may
continue the loop, or break out of it. The error handling after the
loop cleans up the perag reference held when the break occurs. If we
continue, the next loop iteration handles cleaning up the perag
reference.

EIther way, we don't need to release the active perag reference when
xfs_bmap_longest_free_extent() fails. Doing so means we do a double
decrement on the active reference count, and this causes tha active
reference count to fall to zero. At this point, new active
references will fail.

This leads to unmount hanging because it tries to grab active
references to that perag, only for it to fail. This happens inside a
loop that retries until a inode tree radix tree tag is cleared,
which cannot happen because we can't get an active reference to the
perag.

The unmount livelocks in this path:

  xfs_reclaim_inodes+0x80/0xc0
  xfs_unmount_flush_inodes+0x5b/0x70
  xfs_unmountfs+0x5b/0x1a0
