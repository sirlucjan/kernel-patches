Subject: [PATCH 09/47] sched/fair: Fix inaccurate tally of ttwu_move_affine

There are scenarios where non-affine wakeups are incorrectly counted as
affine wakeups by schedstats.

When wake_affine_idle() returns prev_cpu which doesn't equal to
nr_cpumask_bits, it will slip through the check: target == nr_cpumask_bits
in wake_affine() and be counted as if target == this_cpu in schedstats.

Replace target == nr_cpumask_bits with target != this_cpu to make sure
affine wakeups are accurately tallied.

Fixes: 806486c377e33 (sched/fair: Do not migrate if the prev_cpu is idle)
