Subject: [PATCH 13/20] USB: quirks: Add USB_QUIRK_DELAY_INIT for Surface Go 3
 Type-Cover

The touchpad on the Type-Cover of the Surface Go 3 is sometimes not
being initialized properly. Apply USB_QUIRK_DELAY_INIT to fix this
issue.

More specifically, the device in question is a fairly standard modern
touchpad with pointer and touchpad input modes. During setup, the device
needs to be switched from pointer- to touchpad-mode (which is done in
hid-multitouch) to fully utilize it as intended. Unfortunately, however,
this seems to occasionally fail silently, leaving the device in
pointer-mode. Applying USB_QUIRK_DELAY_INIT seems to fix this.
