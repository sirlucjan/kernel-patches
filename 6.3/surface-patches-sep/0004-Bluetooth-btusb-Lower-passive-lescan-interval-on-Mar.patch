Subject: [PATCH 04/20] Bluetooth: btusb: Lower passive lescan interval on
 Marvell 88W8897

The Marvell 88W8897 combined wifi and bluetooth card (pcie+usb version)
is used in a lot of Microsoft Surface devices, and all those devices
suffer from very low 2.4GHz wifi connection speeds while bluetooth is
enabled. The reason for that is that the default passive scanning
interval for Bluetooth Low Energy devices is quite high in Linux
(interval of 60 msec and scan window of 30 msec, see hci_core.c), and
the Marvell chip is known for its bad bt+wifi coexisting performance.

So decrease that passive scan interval and make the scan window shorter
on this particular device to allow for spending more time transmitting
wifi signals: The new scan interval is 250 msec (0x190 * 0.625 msec) and
the new scan window is 6.25 msec (0xa * 0,625 msec).

This change has a very large impact on the 2.4GHz wifi speeds and gets
it up to performance comparable with the Windows driver, which seems to
apply a similar quirk.

The interval and window length were tested and found to work very well
with a lot of Bluetooth Low Energy devices, including the Surface Pen, a
Bluetooth Speaker and two modern Bluetooth headphones. All devices were
discovered immediately after turning them on. Even lower values were
also tested, but they introduced longer delays until devices get
discovered.
