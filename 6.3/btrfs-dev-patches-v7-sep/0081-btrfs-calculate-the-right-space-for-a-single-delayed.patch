Subject: [PATCH 081/147] btrfs: calculate the right space for a single delayed
 ref when refilling

When refilling the delayed block reserve we are incorrectly computing the
amount of bytes for a single delayed reference if the free space tree is
being used. In that case we should double the calculated amount.
Everywhere else we compute the correct amount, like when updating the
delayed block reserve, at btrfs_update_delayed_refs_rsv(), or when
releasing space from the delayed block reserve, at
btrfs_delayed_refs_rsv_release().

So fix btrfs_delayed_refs_rsv_refill() to multiply the amount of bytes for
a single delayed reference by two in case the free space tree is used.
