Subject: [PATCH 4/4] drm/i915: improve the catch-all evict to handle lock
 contention
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The catch-all evict can fail due to object lock contention, since it
only goes as far as trylocking the object, due to us already holding the
vm->mutex. Doing a full object lock here can deadlock, since the
vm->mutex is always our inner lock. Add another execbuf pass which drops
the vm->mutex and then tries to grab the object will the full lock,
before then retrying the eviction. This should be good enough for now to
fix the immediate regression with userspace seeing -ENOSPC from execbuf
due to contended object locks during GTT eviction.

v2 (Mani)
  - Also revamp the docs for the different passes.

Testcase: igt@gem_ppgtt@shrink-vs-evict-*
Fixes: 7e00897be8bf ("drm/i915: Add object locking to i915_gem_evict_for_node and i915_gem_evict_something, v2.")
