Subject: [PATCH 16/35] ext4: avoid BUG_ON when creating xattrs

Commit fb0a387dcdcd ("ext4: limit block allocations for indirect-block
files to < 2^32") added code to try to allocate xattr block with 32-bit
block number for indirect block based files on the grounds that these
files cannot use larger block numbers. It also added BUG_ON when
allocated block could not fit into 32 bits. This is however bogus
reasoning because xattr block is stored in inode->i_file_acl and
inode->i_file_acl_hi and as such even indirect block based files can
happily use full 48 bits for xattr block number. The proper handling
seems to be there basically since 64-bit block number support was added.
So remove the bogus limitation and BUG_ON.
