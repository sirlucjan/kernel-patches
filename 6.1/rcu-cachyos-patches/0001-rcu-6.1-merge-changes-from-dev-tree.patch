-
-Using RCU to Protect Read-Mostly Arrays
-=======================================
-
-Although RCU is more commonly used to protect linked lists, it can
-also be used to protect arrays.  Three situations are as follows:
-
-1.  :ref:`Hash Tables <hash_tables>`
-
-2.  :ref:`Static Arrays <static_arrays>`
-
-3.  :ref:`Resizable Arrays <resizable_arrays>`
-
-Each of these three situations involves an RCU-protected pointer to an
-array that is separately indexed.  It might be tempting to consider use
-of RCU to instead protect the index into an array, however, this use
-case is **not** supported.  The problem with RCU-protected indexes into
-arrays is that compilers can play way too many optimization games with
-integers, which means that the rules governing handling of these indexes
-are far more trouble than they are worth.  If RCU-protected indexes into
-arrays prove to be particularly valuable (which they have not thus far),
-explicit cooperation from the compiler will be required to permit them
-to be safely used.
-
-That aside, each of the three RCU-protected pointer situations are
-described in the following sections.
-
-.. _hash_tables:
-
-Situation 1: Hash Tables
-------------------------
-
-Hash tables are often implemented as an array, where each array entry
-has a linked-list hash chain.  Each hash chain can be protected by RCU
-as described in listRCU.rst.  This approach also applies to other
-array-of-list situations, such as radix trees.
-
-.. _static_arrays:
-
-Situation 2: Static Arrays
---------------------------
-
-Static arrays, where the data (rather than a pointer to the data) is
-located in each array element, and where the array is never resized,
-have not been used with RCU.  Rik van Riel recommends using seqlock in
-this situation, which would also have minimal read-side overhead as long
-as updates are rare.
-
-Quick Quiz:
-		Why is it so important that updates be rare when using seqlock?
-
-:ref:`Answer to Quick Quiz <answer_quick_quiz_seqlock>`
-
-.. _resizable_arrays:
-
-Situation 3: Resizable Arrays
-------------------------------
-
-Use of RCU for resizable arrays is demonstrated by the grow_ary()
-function formerly used by the System V IPC code.  The array is used
-to map from semaphore, message-queue, and shared-memory IDs to the data
-structure that represents the corresponding IPC construct.  The grow_ary()
-function does not acquire any locks; instead its caller must hold the
-ids->sem semaphore.
-
-The grow_ary() function, shown below, does some limit checks, allocates a
-new ipc_id_ary, copies the old to the new portion of the new, initializes
-the remainder of the new, updates the ids->entries pointer to point to
-the new array, and invokes ipc_rcu_putref() to free up the old array.
-Note that rcu_assign_pointer() is used to update the ids->entries pointer,
-which includes any memory barriers required on whatever architecture
-you are running on::
-
-	static int grow_ary(struct ipc_ids* ids, int newsize)
-	{
-		struct ipc_id_ary* new;
-		struct ipc_id_ary* old;
-		int i;
-		int size = ids->entries->size;
-
-		if(newsize > IPCMNI)
-			newsize = IPCMNI;
-		if(newsize <= size)
-			return newsize;
-
-		new = ipc_rcu_alloc(sizeof(struct kern_ipc_perm *)*newsize +
-				    sizeof(struct ipc_id_ary));
-		if(new == NULL)
-			return size;
-		new->size = newsize;
-		memcpy(new->p, ids->entries->p,
-		       sizeof(struct kern_ipc_perm *)*size +
-		       sizeof(struct ipc_id_ary));
-		for(i=size;i<newsize;i++) {
-			new->p[i] = NULL;
-		}
-		old = ids->entries;
-
-		/*
-		 * Use rcu_assign_pointer() to make sure the memcpyed
-		 * contents of the new array are visible before the new
-		 * array becomes visible.
-		 */
-		rcu_assign_pointer(ids->entries, new);
-
-		ipc_rcu_putref(old);
-		return newsize;
-	}
-
-The ipc_rcu_putref() function decrements the array's reference count
-and then, if the reference count has dropped to zero, uses call_rcu()
-to free the array after a grace period has elapsed.
-
-The array is traversed by the ipc_lock() function.  This function
-indexes into the array under the protection of rcu_read_lock(),
-using rcu_dereference() to pick up the pointer to the array so
-that it may later safely be dereferenced -- memory barriers are
-required on the Alpha CPU.  Since the size of the array is stored
-with the array itself, there can be no array-size mismatches, so
-a simple check suffices.  The pointer to the structure corresponding
-to the desired IPC object is placed in "out", with NULL indicating
-a non-existent entry.  After acquiring "out->lock", the "out->deleted"
-flag indicates whether the IPC object is in the process of being
-deleted, and, if not, the pointer is returned::
-
-	struct kern_ipc_perm* ipc_lock(struct ipc_ids* ids, int id)
-	{
-		struct kern_ipc_perm* out;
-		int lid = id % SEQ_MULTIPLIER;
-		struct ipc_id_ary* entries;
-
-		rcu_read_lock();
-		entries = rcu_dereference(ids->entries);
-		if(lid >= entries->size) {
-			rcu_read_unlock();
-			return NULL;
-		}
-		out = entries->p[lid];
-		if(out == NULL) {
-			rcu_read_unlock();
-			return NULL;
-		}
-		spin_lock(&out->lock);
-
-		/* ipc_rmid() may have already freed the ID while ipc_lock
-		 * was spinning: here verify that the structure is still valid
-		 */
-		if (out->deleted) {
-			spin_unlock(&out->lock);
-			rcu_read_unlock();
-			return NULL;
-		}
-		return out;
-	}

-Answer to Quick Quiz:
-	Why is it so important that updates be rare when using seqlock?
-
-	The reason that it is important that updates be rare when
-	using seqlock is that frequent updates can livelock readers.
-	One way to avoid this problem is to assign a seqlock for
-	each array entry rather than to the entire array.

 Using RCU to Protect Read-Mostly Linked Lists
 =============================================
 
-One of the best applications of RCU is to protect read-mostly linked lists

 Example 2: Read-Side Action Taken Outside of Lock: No In-Place Updates
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
-The best applications are cases where, if reader-writer locking were
-used, the read-side lock would be dropped before taking any action
-based on the results of the search.  The most celebrated example is
-the routing table.  Because the routing table is tracking the state of
-equipment outside of the computer, it will at times contain stale data.
-Therefore, once the route has been computed, there is no need to hold
-the routing table static during transmission of the packet.  After all,
-you can hold the routing table static all you want, but that won't keep
-the external Internet from changing, and it is the state of the external
-Internet that really matters.  In addition, routing entries are typically
-added or deleted, rather than being modified in place.
-
-A straightforward example of this use of RCU may be found in the
-system-call auditing support.  For example, a reader-writer locked
+Some reader-writer locking use cases compute a value while holding
+the read-side lock, but continue to use that value after that lock is
+released.  These use cases are often good candidates for conversion
+to RCU.  One prominent example involves network packet routing.
+Because the packet-routing data tracks the state of equipment outside
+of the computer, it will at times contain stale data.  Therefore, once
+the route has been computed, there is no need to hold the routing table
