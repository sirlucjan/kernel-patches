Subject: [PATCH 147/246] btrfs: send: update comment at find_extent_clone()

We have this unclear comment at find_extent_clone() about extents starting
at a file offset greater than or equals to the i_size of the inode. It's
not really informative and it's misleading, since it mentions the author
found such extents with snapshots and large files.

Such extents are a result of fallocate with FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE and there
is no relation to snapshots or large files (all write paths update the
i_size before inserting a new file extent item). So update the comment to
be precise about it and why we don't bother looking for clone sources in
that case.
