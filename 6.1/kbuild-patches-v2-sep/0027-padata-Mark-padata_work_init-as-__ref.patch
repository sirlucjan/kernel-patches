Subject: [PATCH 27/29] padata: Mark padata_work_init() as __ref

When building arm64 allmodconfig + ThinLTO with clang and a proposed
modpost update to account for -ffuncton-sections, the following warning
appears:

  WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o: section mismatch in reference: padata_work_init (section: .text.padata_work_init) -> padata_mt_helper (section: .init.text)
  WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o: section mismatch in reference: padata_work_init (section: .text.padata_work_init) -> padata_mt_helper (section: .init.text)

LLVM has optimized padata_work_init() to include the address of
padata_mt_helper() directly because it inlined the other call to
padata_work_init() with padata_parallel_worker(), meaning the remaining
uses of padata_work_init() use padata_mt_helper() as the work_fn
argument. This optimization causes modpost to complain since
padata_work_init() is not __init, whereas padata_mt_helper() is.

Since padata_work_init() is only called from __init code when
padata_mt_helper() is passed as the work_fn argument, mark
padata_work_init() as __ref, which makes it clear to modpost that this
scenario is okay.
