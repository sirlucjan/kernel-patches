 AMD Pstate Driver Operation Modes
 =================================
 
-``amd_pstate`` CPPC has two operation modes: CPPC Autonomous(active) mode and
-CPPC non-autonomous(passive) mode.
-active mode and passive mode can be chosen by different kernel parameters.
-When in Autonomous mode, CPPC ignores requests done in the Desired Performance
-Target register and takes into account only the values set to the Minimum requested
-performance, Maximum requested performance, and Energy Performance Preference
-registers. When Autonomous is disabled, it only considers the Desired Performance Target.
+``amd_pstate`` CPPC has 3 operation modes: autonomous (active) mode,
+non-autonomous (passive) mode and guided autonomous (guided) mode.
+Active/passive/guided mode can be chosen by different kernel parameters.

+- In autonomous mode, platform ignores the desired performance level request
+  and takes into account only the values set to the minimum, maximum and energy
+  performance preference registers.
+- In non-autonomous mode, platform gets desired performance level
+  from OS directly through Desired Performance Register.
+- In guided-autonomous mode, platform sets operating performance level
+  autonomously according to the current workload and within the limits set by
+  OS through min and max performance registers.
