Subject: [PATCH 24/39] xfs: fix incorrect i_nlink caused by inode racing

The following error occurred during the fsstress test:

XFS: Assertion failed: VFS_I(ip)->i_nlink >= 2, file: fs/xfs/xfs_inode.c, line: 2452

The problem was that inode race condition causes incorrect i_nlink to be
written to disk, and then it is read into memory. Consider the following
call graph, inodes that are marked as both XFS_IFLUSHING and
XFS_IRECLAIMABLE, i_nlink will be reset to 1 and then restored to original
value in xfs_reinit_inode(). Therefore, the i_nlink of directory on disk
may be set to 1.

          xfs_iget_recycle
              xfs_reinit_inode
                  inode_init_always

xfs_reinit_inode() needs to hold the ILOCK_EXCL as it is changing internal
inode state and can race with other RCU protected inode lookups. On the
read side, xfs_iflush_cluster() grabs the ILOCK_SHARED while under rcu +
ip->i_flags_lock, and so xfs_iflush/xfs_inode_to_disk() are protected from
racing inode updates (during transactions) by that lock.

Fixes: ff7bebeb91f8 ("xfs: refactor the inode recycling code") # goes further back than this
