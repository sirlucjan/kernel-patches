Subject: [PATCH 01/17] sched/fair: Detect capacity inversion

Check each performance domain to see if thermal pressure is causing its
capacity to be lower than another performance domain.

We assume that each performance domain has CPUs with the same
capacities, which is similar to an assumption made in energy_model.c

We also assume that thermal pressure impacts all CPUs in a performance
domain equally.

If there're multiple performance domains with the same capacity_orig, we
will trigger a capacity inversion if the domain is under thermal
pressure.

The new cpu_in_capacity_inversion() should help users to know when
information about capacity_orig are not reliable and can opt in to use
the inverted capacity as the 'actual' capacity_orig.

Subject: [PATCH 02/17] sched/fair: Consider capacity inversion in
 util_fits_cpu()

We do consider thermal pressure in util_fits_cpu() for uclamp_min only.
With the exception of the biggest cores which by definition are the max
performance point of the system and all tasks by definition should fit.

Even under thermal pressure, the capacity of the biggest CPU is the
highest in the system and should still fit every task. Except when it
reaches capacity inversion point, then this is no longer true.

We can handle this by using the inverted capacity as capacity_orig in
util_fits_cpu(). Which not only addresses the problem above, but also
ensure uclamp_max now considers the inverted capacity. Force fitting
a task when a CPU is in this adverse state will contribute to making the
thermal throttling last longer.

Subject: [PATCH 03/17] sched/psi: Fix avgs_work re-arm in psi_avgs_work()

Pavan reported a problem that PSI avgs_work idle shutoff is not
working at all. Because PSI_NONIDLE condition would be observed in
psi_avgs_work()->collect_percpu_times()->get_recent_times() even if
only the kworker running avgs_work on the CPU.

Although commit 1b69ac6b40eb ("psi: fix aggregation idle shut-off")
avoided the ping-pong wake problem when the worker sleep, psi_avgs_work()
still will always re-arm the avgs_work, so shutoff is not working.

This patch changes to use PSI_STATE_RESCHEDULE to flag whether to
re-arm avgs_work in get_recent_times(). For the current CPU, we re-arm
avgs_work only when (NR_RUNNING > 1 || NR_IOWAIT > 0 || NR_MEMSTALL > 0),
for other CPUs we can just check PSI_NONIDLE delta. The new flag
is only used in psi_avgs_work(), so we check in get_recent_times()
that current_work() is avgs_work.

One potential problem is that the brief period of non-idle time
incurred between the aggregation run and the kworker's dequeue will
be stranded in the per-cpu buckets until avgs_work run next time.
The buckets can hold 4s worth of time, and future activity will wake
the avgs_work with a 2s delay, giving us 2s worth of data we can leave
behind when shut off the avgs_work. If the kworker run other works after
avgs_work shut off and doesn't have any scheduler activities for 2s,
this maybe a problem.

Subject: [PATCH 04/17] sched/psi: Stop relying on timer_pending() for
 poll_work rescheduling

Psi polling mechanism is trying to minimize the number of wakeups to
run psi_poll_work and is currently relying on timer_pending() to detect
when this work is already scheduled. This provides a window of opportunity
for psi_group_change to schedule an immediate psi_poll_work after
poll_timer_fn got called but before psi_poll_work could reschedule itself.
Below is the depiction of this entire window:

poll_timer_fn
  wake_up_interruptible(&group->poll_wait);

psi_poll_worker
  wait_event_interruptible(group->poll_wait, ...)
  psi_poll_work
    psi_schedule_poll_work
      if (timer_pending(&group->poll_timer)) return;
      ...
      mod_timer(&group->poll_timer, jiffies + delay);

Prior to 461daba06bdc we used to rely on poll_scheduled atomic which was
reset and set back inside psi_poll_work and therefore this race window
was much smaller.
The larger window causes increased number of wakeups and our partners
report visible power regression of ~10mA after applying 461daba06bdc.
Bring back the poll_scheduled atomic and make this race window even
narrower by resetting poll_scheduled only when we reach polling expiration
time. This does not completely eliminate the possibility of extra wakeups
caused by a race with psi_group_change however it will limit it to the
worst case scenario of one extra wakeup per every tracking window (0.5s
in the worst case).
This patch also ensures correct ordering between clearing poll_scheduled
flag and obtaining changed_states using memory barrier. Correct ordering
between updating changed_states and setting poll_scheduled is ensured by
atomic_xchg operation.
By tracing the number of immediate rescheduling attempts performed by
psi_group_change and the number of these attempts being blocked due to
psi monitor being already active, we can assess the effects of this change:

Before the patch:
                                           Run#1    Run#2      Run#3
Immediate reschedules attempted:           684365   1385156    1261240
Immediate reschedules blocked:             682846   1381654    1258682
Immediate reschedules (delta):             1519     3502       2558
Immediate reschedules (% of attempted):    0.22%    0.25%      0.20%

After the patch:
                                           Run#1    Run#2      Run#3
Immediate reschedules attempted:           882244   770298    426218
Immediate reschedules blocked:             881996   769796    426074
Immediate reschedules (delta):             248      502       144
Immediate reschedules (% of attempted):    0.03%    0.07%     0.03%

The number of non-blocked immediate reschedules dropped from 0.22-0.25%
to 0.03-0.07%. The drop is attributed to the decrease in the race window
size and the fact that we allow this race only when psi monitors reach
polling window expiration time.

Subject: [PATCH 05/17] sched/psi: Use task->psi_flags to clear in CPU
 migration

The commit d583d360a620 ("psi: Fix psi state corruption when schedule()
races with cgroup move") fixed a race problem by making cgroup_move_task()
use task->psi_flags instead of looking at the scheduler state.

We can extend task->psi_flags usage to CPU migration, which should be
a minor optimization for performance and code simplicity.

Subject: [PATCH 06/17] sched: Clear ttwu_pending after enqueue_task()

We found a long tail latency in schbench whem m*t is close to nr_cpus.
(e.g., "schbench -m 2 -t 16" on a machine with 32 cpus.)

This is because when the wakee cpu is idle, rq->ttwu_pending is cleared
too early, and idle_cpu() will return true until the wakee task enqueued.
This will mislead the waker when selecting idle cpu, and wake multiple
worker threads on the same wakee cpu. This situation is enlarged by
commit f3dd3f674555 ("sched: Remove the limitation of WF_ON_CPU on
wakelist if wakee cpu is idle") because it tends to use wakelist.

Here is the result of "schbench -m 2 -t 16" on a VM with 32vcpu
(Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8369B).

Subject: [PATCH 07/17] sched/fair: limit sched slice duration

In presence of a lot of small weight tasks like sched_idle tasks, normal
or high weight tasks can see their ideal runtime (sched_slice) to increase
to hundreds ms whereas it normally stays below sysctl_sched_latency.

2 normal tasks running on a CPU will have a max sched_slice of 12ms
(half of the sched_period). This means that they will make progress
every sysctl_sched_latency period.

If we now add 1000 idle tasks on the CPU, the sched_period becomes
3006 ms and the ideal runtime of the normal tasks becomes 609 ms.
It will even become 1500ms if the idle tasks belongs to an idle cgroup.
This means that the scheduler will look for picking another waiting task
after 609ms running time (1500ms respectively). The idle tasks change
significantly the way the 2 normal tasks interleave their running time
slot whereas they should have a small impact.

Such long sched_slice can delay significantly the release of resources
as the tasks can wait hundreds of ms before the next running slot just
because of idle tasks queued on the rq.

Cap the ideal_runtime to sysctl_sched_latency to make sure that tasks will
regularly make progress and will not be significantly impacted by
idle/background tasks queued on the rq.

Subject: [PATCH 08/17] sched/pelt: Change PELT halflife at runtime

Many of the Android devices still prefer to run PELT with a shorter
halflife than the hardcoded value of 32ms in mainline.

The Android folks claim better response time of display pipeline tasks
(higher min and avg fps for 60, 90 or 120Hz refresh rate). Some of the
benchmarks like PCmark web-browsing show higher scores when running
with 16ms or 8ms PELT halflife. The gain in response time and
performance is considered to outweigh the increase of energy
consumption in these cases.

The original idea of introducing a PELT halflife compile time option
for 32, 16, 8ms from Patrick Bellasi in 2018
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180409165134.707-1-patrick.bellasi@arm.com
wasn't integrated into mainline mainly because of breaking the PELT
stability requirement (see (1) below).

We have been experimenting with a new idea from Morten Rasmussen to
instead introduce an additional clock between task and pelt clock. This
way the effect of a shorter PELT halflife of 8ms or 16ms can be
achieved by left-shifting the elapsed time. This is similar to the use
of time shifting of the pelt clock to achieve scale invariance in PELT.
The implementation is from Vincent Donnefort with some minor
modifications to align with current tip sched/core.

Subject: [PATCH 09/17] sched: Async unthrottling for cfs bandwidth

CFS bandwidth currently distributes new runtime and unthrottles cfs_rq's
inline in an hrtimer callback. Runtime distribution is a per-cpu
operation, and unthrottling is a per-cgroup operation, since a tg walk
is required. On machines with a large number of cpus and large cgroup
hierarchies, this cpus*cgroups work can be too much to do in a single
hrtimer callback: since IRQ are disabled, hard lockups may easily occur.
Specifically, we've found this scalability issue on configurations with
256 cpus, O(1000) cgroups in the hierarchy being throttled, and high
memory bandwidth usage.

To fix this, we can instead unthrottle cfs_rq's asynchronously via a
CSD. Each cpu is responsible for unthrottling itself, thus sharding the
total work more fairly across the system, and avoiding hard lockups.

Subject: [PATCH 10/17] sched/core: Micro-optimize ttwu_runnable()

ttwu_runnable() is used as a fast wakeup path when the wakee task
is running on CPU or runnable on RQ, in both cases we can just
set its state to TASK_RUNNING to prevent a sleep.

If the wakee task is on_cpu running, we don't need to update_rq_clock()
or check_preempt_curr().

But if the wakee task is on_rq && !on_cpu (e.g. an IRQ hit before
the task got to schedule() and the task been preempted), we should
check_preempt_curr() to see if it can preempt the current running.

This also removes the class->task_woken() callback from ttwu_runnable(),
which wasn't required per the RT/DL implementations: any required push
operation would have been queued during class->set_next_task() when p
got preempted.

ttwu_runnable() also loses the update to rq->idle_stamp, as by definition
the rq cannot be idle in this scenario.

Subject: [PATCH 11/17] sched/core: Reorganize ttwu_do_wakeup() and
 ttwu_do_activate()

ttwu_do_activate() is used for a complete wakeup, in which we will
activate_task() and use ttwu_do_wakeup() to mark the task runnable
and perform wakeup-preemption, also call class->task_woken() callback
and update the rq->idle_stamp.

Since ttwu_runnable() is not a complete wakeup, don't need all those
done in ttwu_do_wakeup(), so we can move those to ttwu_do_activate()
to simplify ttwu_do_wakeup(), making it only mark the task runnable
to be reused in ttwu_runnable() and try_to_wake_up().

This patch should not have any functional changes.

Subject: [PATCH 12/17] cpufreq, sched/util: Optimize operations with single
 CPU capacity lookup

The max CPU capacity is the same for all CPUs sharing frequency domain.
There is a way to avoid heavy operations in a loop for each CPU by
leveraging this knowledge. Thus, simplify the looping code in the
sugov_next_freq_shared() and drop heavy multiplications. Instead, use
simple max() to get the highest utilization from these CPUs.

This is useful for platforms with many (4 or 6) little CPUs. We avoid
heavy 2*PD_CPU_NUM multiplications in that loop, which is called billions
of times, since it's not limited by the schedutil time delta filter in
sugov_should_update_freq(). When there was no need to change frequency
the code bailed out, not updating the sg_policy::last_freq_update_time.
Then every visit after delta_ns time longer than the
sg_policy::freq_update_delay_ns goes through and triggers the next
frequency calculation code. Although, if the next frequency, as outcome
of that, would be the same as current frequency, we won't update the
sg_policy::last_freq_update_time and the story will be repeated (in
a very short period, sometimes a few microseconds).

The max CPU capacity must be fetched every time we are called, due to
difficulties during the policy setup, where we are not able to get the
normalized CPU capacity at the right time.

The fetched CPU capacity value is than used in sugov_iowait_apply() to
calculate the right boost. This required a few changes in the local
functions and arguments. The capacity value should hopefully be fetched
once when needed and then passed over CPU registers to those functions.

Subject: [PATCH 13/17] sched/fair: unlink misfit task from cpu overutilized

By taking into account uclamp_min, the 1:1 relation between task misfit
and cpu overutilized is no more true as a task with a small util_avg of
may not fit a high capacity cpu because of uclamp_min constraint.

Add a new state in util_fits_cpu() to reflect the case that task would fit
a CPU except for the uclamp_min hint which is a performance requirement.

Use -1 to reflect that a CPU doesn't fit only because of uclamp_min so we
can use this new value to take additional action to select the best CPU
that doesn't match uclamp_min hint.

Subject: [PATCH 14/17] sched/fair: Avoid unnecessary migrations within SMT
 domains

This is v3 of this series. Previous versions can be found here [1] and
here [2]. To avoid duplication, I do not include the cover letter of the
original submission. You can read it in [1].

Changes since v2:

Vincent correctly indicated that I was abusing asym_packing to force load
balances unrelated to CPU priority. The underlying issue is that the
scheduler cannot not handle load balances between SMT and non-SMT cores
correctly. I added several prework patches to fix it... and I removed the
abuse of asym_packing.

Dietmar helped me to realize that there is a better way to check the idle
state of SMT cores. Now I give the task to the scheduler instead of
architecture-specific overrides. I unconditionally obey CPU priorities
at the SMT level. This keeps Power7 happy. At upper levels (i.e., when
balancing load between cores) the scheduler also considers the idle state
of the core in addition to CPU priority. This satisfies x86.

Ionela spotted a violation of the scheduler topology sanity checks. We did
not find a check that suits both Power7 and x86. For now, I removed the
NEEDS_CHILD flag of SD_ASYM_PACKING.

Hopefully, these patches are in sufficiently good shape to be merged.

Thank you for your feedback and I look forward to getting more of it!

Subject: [PATCH 15/17] sched: Introduce classes of tasks for load balance

This is third version of this patchset. Previous versions can be found
here [1] and here [2]. For brevity, I did not include the cover letter
from the original posting. You can read it here [1].

This patchset depends on a separate series to handle better asym_packing
between SMT cores [3].

For convenience, this patchset and [3] can be retrieved from [4] and are
based on the tip tree as on Feb 6th, 2023.

Changes since v2:

Ionela pointed out that the IPCC performance score was vague. I provided
a clearer definition and guidance on how architectures should implement
support for it.

Ionela mentioned that other architectures or scheduling schemes may want
to use IPC classes differently. I restricted its current use to
asym_packing.

Lukasz raised the issue that hardware may not be ready to support IPC
classes early after boot. I added a new interface that drivers or
enablement code can call to enable the use of IPC classes when ready.

Vincent provided multiple suggestions on how to balance non-SMT and SMT
sched groups. His feedback was incorporated in [3]. As a result, now
IPCC statistics are also used to break ties between fully_busy groups.

Dietmar indicated that real-time nor deadline tasks should influence the
CFS load balancing. I implemented such change. Also, as per his suggestion,
I folded the IPCC statistics into the existing struct sg_lb_stats.

Updated patches: 2, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 17
New patches: 9, 20
Unchanged patches: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24

Hopefully, this series is one step closer to be merged.

Thanks in advance for your kind feedback!

BR,
Ricardo

Subject: [PATCH 16/17] sched/deadline: Add more reschedule cases to
 prio_changed_dl()

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230206140612.701871-1-vschneid@redhat.com/T/#u

I've been tracking down an issue on a ~5.17ish kernel where:

  CPUx                           CPUy

  <DL task p0 owns an rtmutex M>
  <p0 depletes its runtime, gets throttled>
  <rq switches to the idle task>
				 <DL task p1 blocks on M, boost/replenish p0>
				 <No call to resched_curr() happens here>

  [idle task keeps running here until *something*
   accidentally sets TIF_NEED_RESCHED]

On that kernel, it is quite easy to trigger using rt-tests's deadline_test
[1] with the test running on isolated CPUs (this reduces the chance of
something unrelated setting TIF_NEED_RESCHED on the idle tasks, making the
issue even more obvious as the hung task detector chimes in).

I haven't been able to reproduce this using a mainline kernel, even if I
revert

  2972e3050e35 ("tracing: Make trace_marker{,_raw} stream-like")

which gets rid of the lock involved in the above test, *but* I cannot
convince myself the issue isn't there from looking at the code.

Make prio_changed_dl() issue a reschedule if the current task isn't a
deadline one. While at it, ensure a reschedule is emitted when a
queued-but-not-current task gets boosted with an earlier deadline that
current's.
