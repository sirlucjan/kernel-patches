Subject: [PATCH 243/246] btrfs: remove outdated logic from overwrite_item()
 and add assertion

As of commit 193df6245704 ("btrfs: search for last logged dir index if
it's not cached in the inode"), the overwrite_item() function is always
called for a root that is from a fs/subvolume tree. In other words, now
it's only used during log replay to modify a fs/subvolume tree. Therefore
we can remove the logic that checks if we are dealing with a log tree at
overwrite_item().

So remove that logic, replacing it with an assertion and document that if
we ever need to support a log root there, we will need to clone the leaf
from the fs/subvolume tree and then release it before modifying the log
tree, which is needed to avoid a potential deadlock, similar to the one
recently fixed by a patch with the subject:

  "btrfs: do not modify log tree while holding a leaf from fs tree locked"
