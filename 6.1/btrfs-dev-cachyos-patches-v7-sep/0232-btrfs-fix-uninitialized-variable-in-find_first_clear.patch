Subject: [PATCH 232/236] btrfs: fix uninitialized variable in
 find_first_clear_extent_bit

This was caught when syncing extent-io-tree.c into btrfs-progs.  This
however isn't really a problem, the only way next would be uninitialized
is if we found the range we were looking for, and in this case we don't
care about next.  However it's a compile error, so fix it up.
