Subject: [PATCH 057/247] btrfs: do not use GFP_ATOMIC in the read endio

We have done read endio in an async thread for a very, very long time,
which makes the use of GFP_ATOMIC and unlock_extent_atomic() unneeded in
our read endio path.  We've noticed under heavy memory pressure in our
fleet that we can fail these allocations, and then often trip a
BUG_ON(!allocation), which isn't an ideal outcome.  Begin to address
this by simply not using GFP_ATOMIC, which will allow us to do things
like actually allocate a extent state when doing
set_extent_bits(UPTODATE) in the endio handler.

End io handlers are not called in atomic context, besides we have been
allocating failrec with GFP_NOFS so we'd notice there's a problem.
