Subject: [PATCH 159/247] btrfs: send: bump the extent reference count limit
 for backref walking

After the previous patchset which is comprised of the following patches:

  01/17 btrfs: fix inode list leak during backref walking at resolve_indirect_refs()
  02/17 btrfs: fix inode list leak during backref walking at find_parent_nodes()
  03/17 btrfs: fix ulist leaks in error paths of qgroup self tests
  04/17 btrfs: remove pointless and double ulist frees in error paths of qgroup tests
  05/17 btrfs: send: avoid unnecessary path allocations when finding extent clone
  06/17 btrfs: send: update comment at find_extent_clone()
  07/17 btrfs: send: drop unnecessary backref context field initializations
  08/17 btrfs: send: avoid unnecessary backref lookups when finding clone source
  09/17 btrfs: send: optimize clone detection to increase extent sharing
  10/17 btrfs: use a single argument for extent offset in backref walking functions
  11/17 btrfs: use a structure to pass arguments to backref walking functions
  12/17 btrfs: reuse roots ulist on each leaf iteration for iterate_extent_inodes()
  13/17 btrfs: constify ulist parameter of ulist_next()
  14/17 btrfs: send: cache leaf to roots mapping during backref walking
  15/17 btrfs: send: skip unnecessary backref iterations
  16/17 btrfs: send: avoid double extent tree search when finding clone source
  17/17 btrfs: send: skip resolution of our own backref when finding clone source

we have now much better performance when doing backref walking in the send
code, so we can increase the current limit from 64 to 1024 references.
This limit is still a bit conservative because there are still edge cases
where backref walking will be too slow and spend a lot of cpu time, some IO
reading b+tree nodes/leaves and memory. The goal is to eventually get rid
of any limit, but for now bump it as it benefits users with extents shared
more than 64 times and up to 1024 times, allowing for more deduplication
at the destination without having to run a dedupe tool after a receive.
