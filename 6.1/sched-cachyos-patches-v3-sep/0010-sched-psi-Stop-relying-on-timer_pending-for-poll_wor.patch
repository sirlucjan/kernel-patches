Subject: [PATCH 10/19] sched/psi: Stop relying on timer_pending() for
 poll_work rescheduling

Psi polling mechanism is trying to minimize the number of wakeups to
run psi_poll_work and is currently relying on timer_pending() to detect
when this work is already scheduled. This provides a window of opportunity
for psi_group_change to schedule an immediate psi_poll_work after
poll_timer_fn got called but before psi_poll_work could reschedule itself.
Below is the depiction of this entire window:

poll_timer_fn
  wake_up_interruptible(&group->poll_wait);

psi_poll_worker
  wait_event_interruptible(group->poll_wait, ...)
  psi_poll_work
    psi_schedule_poll_work
      if (timer_pending(&group->poll_timer)) return;
      ...
      mod_timer(&group->poll_timer, jiffies + delay);

Prior to 461daba06bdc we used to rely on poll_scheduled atomic which was
reset and set back inside psi_poll_work and therefore this race window
was much smaller.
The larger window causes increased number of wakeups and our partners
report visible power regression of ~10mA after applying 461daba06bdc.
Bring back the poll_scheduled atomic and make this race window even
narrower by resetting poll_scheduled only when we reach polling expiration
time. This does not completely eliminate the possibility of extra wakeups
caused by a race with psi_group_change however it will limit it to the
worst case scenario of one extra wakeup per every tracking window (0.5s
in the worst case).
This patch also ensures correct ordering between clearing poll_scheduled
flag and obtaining changed_states using memory barrier. Correct ordering
between updating changed_states and setting poll_scheduled is ensured by
atomic_xchg operation.
By tracing the number of immediate rescheduling attempts performed by
psi_group_change and the number of these attempts being blocked due to
psi monitor being already active, we can assess the effects of this change:

Before the patch:
                                           Run#1    Run#2      Run#3
Immediate reschedules attempted:           684365   1385156    1261240
Immediate reschedules blocked:             682846   1381654    1258682
Immediate reschedules (delta):             1519     3502       2558
Immediate reschedules (% of attempted):    0.22%    0.25%      0.20%

After the patch:
                                           Run#1    Run#2      Run#3
Immediate reschedules attempted:           882244   770298    426218
Immediate reschedules blocked:             881996   769796    426074
Immediate reschedules (delta):             248      502       144
Immediate reschedules (% of attempted):    0.03%    0.07%     0.03%

The number of non-blocked immediate reschedules dropped from 0.22-0.25%
to 0.03-0.07%. The drop is attributed to the decrease in the race window
size and the fact that we allow this race only when psi monitors reach
polling window expiration time.
