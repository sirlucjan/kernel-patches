Subject: [PATCH 54/92] tools/memory-model: Add data-race capabilities to
 judgelitmus.sh

This commit adds functionality to judgelitmus.sh to allow it to handle
both the "DATARACE" markers in the "Result:" comments in litmus tests
and the "Flag data-race" markers in LKMM output.  For C-language tests,
if either marker is present, the other must also be as well, at least for
litmus tests having a "Result:" comment.  If the LKMM output indicates
a data race, then failures of the Always/Sometimes/Never portion of the
"Result:" prediction are forgiven.

The reason for forgiving "Result:" mispredictions is that data races can
result in "interesting" compiler optimizations, so that all bets are off
in the data-race case.

[ paulmck: Apply Akira Yokosawa feedback. ]
