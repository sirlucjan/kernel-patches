Subject: [PATCH 129/248] btrfs: update stale comment for nowait direct IO
 writes

If when doing a direct IO write we need to fallback to buffered IO, we
this comment at btrfs_direct_write() that says we can't directly fallback
to buffered IO if we have a NOWAIT iocb, because we have no support for
NOWAIT buffered writes. That is not true anymore, as support for NOWAIT
buffered writes was added recently in commit 926078b21db9 ("btrfs: enable
nowait async buffered writes").

However we still can't fallback to a buffered write in case we have a
NOWAIT iocb, because we'll need to flush delalloc and wait for it to
complete after doing the buffered write, and that can block for several
reasons, the main reason being waiting for IO to complete.

So update the comment to mention all that.
