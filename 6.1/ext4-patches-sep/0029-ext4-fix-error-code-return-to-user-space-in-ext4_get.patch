Subject: [PATCH 29/58] ext4: fix error code return to user-space in
 ext4_get_branch()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

If a block is out of range in ext4_get_branch(), -ENOMEM will be returned
to user-space.  Obviously, this error code isn't really useful.  This
patch fixes it by making sure the right error code (-EFSCORRUPTED) is
propagated to user-space.  EUCLEAN is more informative than ENOMEM.
