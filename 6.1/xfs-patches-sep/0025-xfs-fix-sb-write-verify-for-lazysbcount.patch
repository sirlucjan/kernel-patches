Subject: [PATCH 25/59] xfs: fix sb write verify for lazysbcount

When lazysbcount is enabled, fsstress and loop mount/unmount test report
the following problems:

XFS (loop0): SB summary counter sanity check failed
XFS (loop0): Metadata corruption detected at xfs_sb_write_verify+0x13b/0x460,
	xfs_sb block 0x0
XFS (loop0): Unmount and run xfs_repair
XFS (loop0): First 128 bytes of corrupted metadata buffer:

XFS (loop0): Corruption of in-memory data (0x8) detected at _xfs_buf_ioapply
	+0xe1e/0x10e0 (fs/xfs/xfs_buf.c:1580).  Shutting down filesystem.
XFS (loop0): Please unmount the filesystem and rectify the problem(s)
XFS (loop0): log mount/recovery failed: error -117
XFS (loop0): log mount failed

This corruption will shutdown the file system and the file system will
no longer be mountable. The following script can reproduce the problem,
but it may take a long time.

 #!/bin/bash

 device=/dev/sda
 testdir=/mnt/test
 round=0

 function fail()
 {
	 echo "$*"
	 exit 1
 }

 mkdir -p $testdir
 while [ $round -lt 10000 ]
 do
	 echo "******* round $round ********"
	 mkfs.xfs -f $device
	 mount $device $testdir || fail "mount failed!"
	 fsstress -d $testdir -l 0 -n 10000 -p 4 >/dev/null &
	 sleep 4
	 killall -w fsstress
	 umount $testdir
	 xfs_repair -e $device > /dev/null
	 if [ $? -eq 2 ];then
		 echo "ERR CODE 2: Dirty log exception during repair."
		 exit 1
	 fi
	 round=$(($round+1))
 done

With lazysbcount is enabled, There is no additional lock protection for
reading m_ifree and m_icount in xfs_log_sb(), if other cpu modifies the
m_ifree, this will make the m_ifree greater than m_icount. For example,
consider the following sequence and ifreedelta is postive:

 CPU0				 CPU1
 xfs_log_sb			 xfs_trans_unreserve_and_mod_sb
 ----------			 ------------------------------
 percpu_counter_sum(&mp->m_icount)
				 percpu_counter_add_batch(&mp->m_icount,
						idelta, XFS_ICOUNT_BATCH)
				 percpu_counter_add(&mp->m_ifree, ifreedelta);
 percpu_counter_sum(&mp->m_ifree)

After this, incorrect inode count (sb_ifree > sb_icount) will be writen to
the log. In the subsequent writing of sb, incorrect inode count (sb_ifree >
sb_icount) will fail to pass the boundary check in xfs_validate_sb_write()
that cause the file system shutdown.

When lazysbcount is enabled, we don't need to guarantee that Lazy sb
counters are completely correct, but we do need to guarantee that sb_ifree
<= sb_icount. On the other hand, the constraint that m_ifree <= m_icount
must be satisfied any time that there /cannot/ be other threads allocating
or freeing inode chunks. If the constraint is violated under these
circumstances, sb_i{count,free} (the ondisk superblock inode counters)
maybe incorrect and need to be marked sick at unmount, the count will
be rebuilt on the next mount.
