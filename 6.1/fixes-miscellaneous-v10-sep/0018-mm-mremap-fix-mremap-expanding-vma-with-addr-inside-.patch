Subject: [PATCH 18/21] mm, mremap: fix mremap() expanding vma with addr inside
 vma
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since 6.1 we have noticed random rpm install failures that were tracked
to mremap() returning -ENOMEM and to commit ca3d76b0aa80 ("mm: add
merging after mremap resize").

The problem occurs when mremap() expands a VMA in place, but using an
starting address that's not vma->vm_start, but somewhere in the middle.
The extension_pgoff calculation introduced by the commit is wrong in
that case, so vma_merge() fails due to pgoffs not being compatible.
Fix the calculation.

By the way it seems that the situations, where rpm now expands a vma
from the middle, were made possible also due to that commit, thanks to
the improved vma merging. Yet it should work just fine, except for the
buggy calculation.
