Subject: [PATCH 02/18] ZEN: mm: Lower the non-hugetlbpage pageblock size to
 reduce scheduling delays

The page allocator processes free pages in groups of pageblocks, where
the size of a pageblock is typically quite large (1024 pages without
hugetlbpage support). Pageblocks are processed atomically with the zone
lock held, which can cause severe scheduling delays on both the CPU
going through the pageblock and any other CPUs waiting to acquire the
zone lock. A frequent offender is move_freepages_block(), which is used
by rmqueue() for page allocation.

As it turns out, there's no requirement for pageblocks to be so large,
so the pageblock order can simply be reduced to ease the scheduling
delays and zone lock contention. PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER is used as a
reasonable setting to ensure non-costly page allocation requests can
still be serviced without always needing to free up more than one
pageblock's worth of pages at a time.

This has a noticeable effect on overall system latency when memory
pressure is elevated. The various mm functions which operate on
pageblocks no longer appear in the preemptoff tracer, where previously
they would spend up to 100 ms on a mobile arm64 CPU processing a
pageblock with preemption disabled and the zone lock held.

+ * DOC: Overview
+ *
+ * The ``blkdev`` LED trigger works by periodically checking the activity
+ * counters of block devices that have been linked to one or more LEDs and
+ * blinking those LED(s) if the correct type of activity has occurred.  The
+ * periodic check is scheduled with the Linux kernel's deferred work facility.
+ *
+ * Trigger-specific data about block devices and LEDs is stored in two data
+ * structures --- &struct blkdev_trig_bdev (a "BTB") and &struct blkdev_trig_led
+ * (a "BTL").  Each structure contains a &struct xarray that holds links to any
+ * linked devices of the other type.  I.e. &blkdev_trig_bdev.linked_btls
+ * contains links to all BTLs whose LEDs have been linked to the BTB's block
+ * device, and &blkdev_trig_led.linked_btbs contains links to all BTBs whose
+ * block devices have been linked to the BTL's LED.  Thus, a block device can
+ * be linked to more than one LED, and an LED can be linked to more than one
+ * block device.

+=================================
+Block Device (blkdev) LED Trigger
+=================================
+
+Available when ``CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV=y`` or
+``CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV=m``.
+
+See also:
+
+* ``Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-trigger-blkdev``
+* ``Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-block`` (``/sys/block/<disk>/linked_leds``)
+
+Overview
+========
+
+.. note::
+	The examples below use ``<LED>`` to refer to the name of a
+	system-specific LED.  If no suitable LED is available on a test
+	system (in a virtual machine, for example), it is possible to
+	use a userspace LED.  (See ``Documentation/leds/uleds.rst``.)
+
+Verify that the ``blkdev`` LED trigger is available::
+
+	# grep blkdev /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
+	... rfkill-none blkdev
+
+(If the previous command produces no output, you may need to load the trigger
+module - ``modprobe ledtrig_blkdev``.  If the module is not available, check
+the value of ``CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV`` in your kernel configuration.)
+
+Associate the LED with the ``blkdev`` LED trigger::
+
+	# echo blkdev > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
+
+	# cat /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
+	... rfkill-none [blkdev]
+
+Note that several new device attributes are available in the
+``/sys/class/leds/<LED>`` directory.
+
+* ``link_dev_by_path``, ``unlink_dev_by_path``, and ``unlink_dev_by_name`` are
+  used to manage the set of block devices associated with this LED.  The LED
+  will blink when activity occurs on any of its linked devices.
+
+* ``blink_on_read``, ``blink_on_write``, ``blink_on_discard``, and
+  ``blink_on_flush`` are boolean values that determine whether the LED will
+  blink when a particular type of activity is detected on one of its linked
+  block devices.
+
+* ``blink_time`` is the duration (in milliseconds) of each blink of this LED.
+  (The minimum value is 10 milliseconds.)
+
+* ``check_interval`` is the frequency (in milliseconds) with which block devices
+  linked to this LED will be checked for activity and the LED blinked (if the
+  correct type of activity has occurred).
+
+* The ``linked_devices`` directory will contain a symbolic link to every device
+  that is associated with this LED.
+
+Link a block device to the LED::
+
+	# echo /dev/sda > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/link_dev_by_path
+
+	# ls /sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices
+	sda
+
+(The value written to ``link_dev_by_path`` must be the path of the device
+special file, such as ``/dev/sda``, that represents the block device - or the
+path of a symbolic link to such a device special file.)
+
+Activity on the device will now cause the LED to blink.  The duration of each
+blink (in milliseconds) can be adjusted by setting
+``/sys/class/leds/<LED>/blink_time``.  (But see **check_interval and
+blink_time** below.)
+
+Associate a second device with the LED::
+
+	# echo /dev/sdb > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/link_dev_by_path
+
+	# ls /sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices
+	sda  sdb
+
+When a block device is linked to one or more LEDs, the LEDs are linked from
+the device's ``linked_leds`` directory::
+
+	# ls /sys/class/block/sd{a,b}/linked_leds
+	/sys/class/block/sda/linked_leds:
+	<LED>
+
+	/sys/class/block/sdb/linked_leds:
+	<LED>
+
+(The ``linked_leds`` directory only exists when the block device is linked to
+at least one LED.)
+
+``check_interval`` and ``blink_time``
+=====================================
+
+* By default, linked block devices are checked for activity every 100
+  milliseconds.  This frequency can be changed for an LED via the
+  ``/sys/class/leds/<led>/check_interval`` attribute.  (The minimum value is 25
+  milliseconds.)
+
+* All block devices associated with an LED are checked for activity every
+  ``check_interval`` milliseconds, and a blink is triggered if the correct type
+  of activity (as determined by the LED's ``blink_on_*`` attributes) is
+  detected.  The duration of an LED's blink is determined by its ``blink_time``
+  attribute.  Thus (when the correct type of activity is detected), the LED will
+  be on for ``blink_time`` milliseconds and off for
+  ``check_interval - blink_time`` milliseconds.
+
+* The LED subsystem ignores new blink requests for an LED that is already in
+  in the process of blinking, so setting a ``blink_time`` greater than or equal
+  to ``check_interval`` will cause some blinks to be missed.
+
+* Because of processing times, scheduling latencies, etc., avoiding missed
+  blinks actually requires a difference of at least a few milliseconds between
+  the ``blink_time`` and ``check_interval``.  The required difference is likely
+  to vary from system to system.  As a  reference, a Thecus N5550 NAS requires a
+  difference of 7 milliseconds (e.g. ``check_interval == 100``,
+  ``blink_time == 93``).
+
+* The default values (``check_interval == 100``, ``blink_time == 75``) cause the
+  LED associated with a continuously active device to blink rapidly.  For a more
+  "always on" effect, increase the ``blink_time`` (but not too much; see the
+  previous bullet).
+
+Other Notes
+===========
+
+* Many (possibly all) types of block devices work with this trigger, including:
+
+  * SCSI (including SATA and USB) hard disk drives and SSDs
+  * SCSI (including SATA and USB) optical drives
+  * NVMe SSDs
+  * SD cards
+  * loopback block devices (``/dev/loop*``)
+  * device mapper devices, such as LVM logical volumes
+  * MD RAID devices
+  * zRAM compressed RAM-disks
+  * partitions on block devices that support them
+
+* The names of the symbolic links in ``/sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices``
+  are **kernel** names, which may not match the paths used for
+  ``link_dev_by_path`` and ``unlink_dev_by_path``.  This is most likely when a
+  symbolic link is used to refer to the device (as is common with logical
+  volumes), but it can be true for any device, because nothing prevents the
+  creation of device special files with arbitrary names (e.g.
+  ``sudo mknod /foo b 8 0``).
+
+  Kernel names can be used to unlink block devices from LEDs by writing them to
+  the LED's ``unlink_dev_by_name`` attribute.
+
+* The ``blkdev`` LED trigger supports many-to-many device/LED associations.
+  A device can be associated with multiple LEDs, and an LED can be associated
+  with multiple devices.

Currently, if wbt is initialized and then disabled by
wbt_disable_default(), sysfs will still show valid wbt_lat_usec, which
will confuse users that wbt is still enabled.

This patch shows wbt_lat_usec as zero if it's disabled.

There are only one flag to indicate that elevator is registered currently,
prepare to add a flag to disable wbt if default elevator is bfq.

Subject: [PATCH 10/18] blk-wbt: don't enable throttling if default elevator is
 bfq

Commit b5dc5d4d1f4f ("block,bfq: Disable writeback throttling") tries to
disable wbt for bfq, it's done by calling wbt_disable_default() in
bfq_init_queue(). However, wbt is still enabled if default elevator is
bfq:

device_add_disk
 elevator_init_mq
  bfq_init_queue
   wbt_disable_default -> done nothing

 blk_register_queue
  wbt_enable_default -> wbt is enabled

Fix the problem by adding a new flag ELEVATOR_FLAG_DISBALE_WBT, bfq
will set the flag in bfq_init_queue, and following wbt_enable_default()
won't enable wbt while the flag is set.

Subject: [PATCH 11/18] mm: vmscan: make rotations a secondary factor in
 balancing anon vs file

We noticed a 2% webserver throughput regression after upgrading from 5.6.
This could be tracked down to a shift in the anon/file reclaim balance
(confirmed with swappiness) that resulted in worse reclaim efficiency and
thus more kswapd activity for the same outcome.

The change that exposed the problem is aae466b0052e ("mm/swap: implement
workingset detection for anonymous LRU").  By qualifying swapins based on
their refault distance, it lowered the cost of anon reclaim in this
workload, in turn causing (much) more anon scanning than before.  Scanning
the anon list is more expensive due to the higher ratio of mmapped pages
that may rotate during reclaim, and so the result was an increase in %sys
time.

Right now, rotations aren't considered a cost when balancing scan pressure
between LRUs.  We can end up with very few file refaults putting all the
scan pressure on hot anon pages that are rotated en masse, don't get
reclaimed, and never push back on the file LRU again.  We still only
reclaim file cache in that case, but we burn a lot CPU rotating anon
pages.  It's "fair" from an LRU age POV, but doesn't reflect the real cost
it imposes on the system.

Consider rotations as a secondary factor in balancing the LRUs.  This
doesn't attempt to make a precise comparison between IO cost and CPU cost,
it just says: if reloads are about comparable between the lists, or
rotations are overwhelmingly different, adjust for CPU work.

This fixed the regression on our webservers.  It has since been deployed
to the entire Meta fleet and hasn't caused any problems.

Subject: [PATCH 12/18] objtool: Optimize elf_dirty_reloc_sym()

When moving a symbol in the symtab its index changes and any reloc
referring that symtol-table-index will need to be rewritten too.

In order to facilitate this, objtool simply marks the whole reloc
section 'changed' which will cause the whole section to be
re-generated.

However, finding the relocs that use any given symbol is implemented
rather crudely -- a fully iteration of all sections and their relocs.
Given that some builds have over 20k sections (kallsyms etc..)
iterating all that for *each* symbol moved takes a bit of time.

Instead have each symbol keep a list of relocs that reference it.

This *vastly* improves build times for certain configs.

Prior to commit 5d45950dfbb1 ("kbuild: move vmlinux.o link to
scripts/Makefile.vmlinux_o"), jobserver-exec was invoked from the shell
script, link-vmlinux.sh. It can get access to the jobserver because
Makefile adds '+' prefix, as in:

    +$(call if_changed_dep,link_vmlinux)

Since 5d45950dfbb1, jobserver-exec is invoked from Makefile, but the
'+' prefix is missing, hence jobserver-exec has no access to the
jobserver.

Subject: [PATCH 14/18] x86/split_lock: Add sysctl to control the misery mode

Commit b041b525dab9 ("x86/split_lock: Make life miserable for split lockers")
changed the way the split lock detector works when in "warn" mode;
basically, it not only shows the warn message, but also intentionally
introduces a slowdown through sleeping plus serialization mechanism
on such task. Based on discussions in [0], seems the warning alone
wasn't enough motivation for userspace developers to fix their
applications.

This slowdown is enough to totally break some proprietary (aka.
unfixable) userspace[1].

Happens that originally the proposal in [0] was to add a new mode
which would warns + slowdown the "split locking" task, keeping the
old warn mode untouched. In the end, that idea was discarded and
the regular/default "warn" mode now slows down the applications. This
is quite aggressive with regards proprietary/legacy programs that
basically are unable to properly run in kernel with this change.
While it is understandable that a malicious application could DoS
by split locking, it seems unacceptable to regress old/proprietary
userspace programs through a default configuration that previously
worked. An example of such breakage was reported in [1].

Add a sysctl to allow controlling the "misery mode" behavior, as per
Thomas suggestion on [2]. This way, users running legacy and/or
proprietary software are allowed to still execute them with a decent
performance while still observing the warning messages on kernel log.

+split_lock_mitigate (x86 only)
+==============================
+
+On x86, each "split lock" imposes a system-wide performance penalty. On larger
+systems, large numbers of split locks from unprivileged users can result in
+denials of service to well-behaved and potentially more important users.
+
+The kernel mitigates these bad users by detecting split locks and imposing
+penalties: forcing them to wait and only allowing one core to execute split
+locks at a time.
+

Subject: [PATCH 15/18] ACPICA: Fix error code path in
 acpi_ds_call_control_method()

A use-after-free in acpi_ps_parse_aml() after a failing invocaion of
acpi_ds_call_control_method() is reported by KASAN [1] and code
inspection reveals that next_walk_state pushed to the thread by
acpi_ds_create_walk_state() is freed on errors, but it is not popped
from the thread beforehand.  Thus acpi_ds_get_current_walk_state()
called by acpi_ps_parse_aml() subsequently returns it as the new
walk state which is incorrect.

To address this, make acpi_ds_call_control_method() call
acpi_ds_pop_walk_state() to pop next_walk_state from the thread before
returning an error.

Subject: [PATCH 16/18] ACPICA: Fix use-after-free in

There is an use-after-free reported by KASAN:

   ...
   </TASK>

The root cause of the problem is that the acpi_operand_object
is freed when acpi_ut_walk_package_tree() fails in
acpi_ut_copy_ipackage_to_ipackage(), lead to repeated release in
acpi_ut_copy_iobject_to_iobject(). The problem was introduced
by "8aa5e56eeb61" commit, this commit is to fix memory leak in
acpi_ut_copy_iobject_to_iobject(), repeatedly adding remove
operation, lead to "acpi_operand_object" used after free.

Fix it by removing acpi_ut_remove_reference() in
acpi_ut_copy_ipackage_to_ipackage(). acpi_ut_copy_ipackage_to_ipackage()
is called to copy an internal package object into another internal
package object, when it fails, the memory of acpi_operand_object
should be freed by the caller.

Subject: [PATCH 17/18] drm/amdgpu: Fix type of second parameter in
 odn_edit_dpm_table() callback

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A
proposed warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which
reveals:

  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../pm/swsmu/amdgpu_smu.c:3008:29: error: incompatible function pointer types initializing 'int (*)(void *, uint32_t, long *, uint32_t)' (aka 'int (*)(void *, unsigned int, long *, unsigned int)') with an expression of type 'int (void *, enum PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND, long *, uint32_t)' (aka 'int (void *, enum PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND, long *, unsigned int)') [-Werror,-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict]

                                     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1 error generated.

There are only two implementations of ->odn_edit_dpm_table() in 'struct
amd_pm_funcs': smu_od_edit_dpm_table() and pp_odn_edit_dpm_table(). One
has a second parameter type of 'enum PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND' and the
other uses 'u32'. Ultimately, smu_od_edit_dpm_table() calls
->od_edit_dpm_table() from 'struct pptable_funcs' and
pp_odn_edit_dpm_table() calls ->odn_edit_dpm_table() from 'struct
pp_hwmgr_func', which both have a second parameter type of 'enum
PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND'.

Update the type parameter in both the prototype in 'struct amd_pm_funcs'
and pp_odn_edit_dpm_table() to 'enum PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND', which
cleans up the warning.
