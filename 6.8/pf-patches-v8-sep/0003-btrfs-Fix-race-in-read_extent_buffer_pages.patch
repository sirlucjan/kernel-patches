Subject: [PATCH 03/11] btrfs: Fix race in read_extent_buffer_pages()

To prevent concurrent reads for the same extent buffer,
read_extent_buffer_pages() performs these checks:

    /* (1) */
    if (test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE, &eb->bflags))
        return 0;

    /* (2) */
    if (test_and_set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags))
        goto done;

At this point, it seems safe to start the actual read operation. Once
that completes, end_bbio_meta_read() does

    /* (3) */
    set_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb);

    /* (4) */
    clear_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags);

Normally, this is enough to ensure only one read happens, and all other
callers wait for it to finish before returning.  Unfortunately, there is
a racey interleaving:

    Thread A | Thread B | Thread C
    ---------+----------+---------
       (1)   |          |
             |    (1)   |
       (2)   |          |
       (3)   |          |
       (4)   |          |
             |    (2)   |
             |          |    (1)

When this happens, thread B kicks of an unnecessary read. Worse, thread
C will see UPTODATE set and return immediately, while the read from
thread B is still in progress.  This race could result in tree-checker
errors like this as the extent buffer is concurrently modified:

    BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted node, root=256
    block=8550954455682405139 owner mismatch, have 11858205567642294356
    expect [256, 18446744073709551360]

Fix it by testing UPTODATE again after setting the READING bit, and if
it's been set, skip the unnecessary read.
