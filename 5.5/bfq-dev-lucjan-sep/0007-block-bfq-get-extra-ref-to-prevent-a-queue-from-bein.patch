Subject: [PATCH 07/17] block, bfq: get extra ref to prevent a queue from being
 freed during a group move

In bfq_bfqq_move(), the bfq_queue, say Q, to be moved to a new group
may happen to be deactivated in the scheduling data structures of the
source group (and then activated in the destination group). If Q is
referred only by the data structures in the source group when the
deactivation happens, then Q is freed upon the deactivation.

This commit addresses this issue by getting an extra reference before
the possible deactivation, and releasing this extra reference after Q
has been moved.
