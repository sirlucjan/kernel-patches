Subject: [PATCH 21/29] btrfs: fix unexpected error path when reflinking an
 inline extent

When reflinking an inline extent, we assert that its file offset is 0 and
that its uncompressed length is not greater than the sector size. We then
return an error if one of those conditions is not satisfied. However we
use a return statement, which results in returning from btrfs_clone()
without freeing the path and buffer that were allocated before, as well as
not clearing the flag BTRFS_INODE_NO_DELALLOC_FLUSH for the destination
inode.

Fix that by jumping to the 'out' label instead, and also add a WARN_ON()
for each condition so that in case assertions are disabled, we get to
known which of the unexpected conditions triggered the error.

Fixes: a61e1e0df9f321 ("Btrfs: simplify inline extent handling when doing reflinks")
