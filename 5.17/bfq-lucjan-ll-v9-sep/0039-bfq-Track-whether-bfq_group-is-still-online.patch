Subject: [PATCH 39/65] bfq: Track whether bfq_group is still online

Track whether bfq_group is still online. We cannot rely on
blkcg_gq->online because that gets cleared only after all policies are
offlined and we need something that gets updated already under
bfqd->lock when we are cleaning up our bfq_group to be able to guarantee
that when we see online bfq_group, it will stay online while we are
holding bfqd->lock lock.
