Subject: [PATCH 13/17] block, bfq: make bfq_has_work() more accurate

bfq_has_work() is using busy_queues currently, which is not accurate
because bfq_queue is busy doesn't represent that it has requests. Since
bfqd aready has a counter 'queued' to record how many requests are in
bfq, use it instead of busy_queues.

Noted that bfq_has_work() can be called with 'bfqd->lock' held, thus the
lock can't be held in bfq_has_work() to protect 'bfqd->queued'.
