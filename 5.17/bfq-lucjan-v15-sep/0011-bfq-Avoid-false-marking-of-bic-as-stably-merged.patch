Subject: [PATCH 11/85] bfq: Avoid false marking of bic as stably merged

bfq_setup_cooperator() can mark bic as stably merged even though it
decides to not merge its bfqqs (when bfq_setup_merge() returns NULL).
Make sure to mark bic as stably merged only if we are really going to
merge bfqqs.

CC: stable@vger.kernel.org
Fixes: 430a67f9d616 ("block, bfq: merge bursts of newly-created queues")
