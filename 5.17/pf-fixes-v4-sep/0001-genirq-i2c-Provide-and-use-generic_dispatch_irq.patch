Subject: [PATCH 01/11] genirq, i2c: Provide and use generic_dispatch_irq()

Carlos reported that on his system booting with 'threadirqs' on the command
line result in the following warning:

irq 31 handler irq_default_primary_handler+0x0/0x10 enabled interrupts
WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 989 at kernel/irq/handle.c:153 __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x19f/0x1b0

The reason is in the i2c stack:

    i801_isr()
      i801_host_notify_isr()
        i2c_handle_smbus_host_notify()
          generic_handle_irq()

and that explodes with forced interrupt threading because it's called with
interrupts enabled.

It would be possible to set IRQF_NO_THREAD on the i801 interrupt to exclude
it from force threading, but that would break on RT and require a larger
update.

It's also unclear whether there are other drivers which can reach that code
path via i2c_slave_host_notify_cb(). As there are enough i2c drivers which
use threaded interrupt handlers by default it seems not completely
impossible that this can happen even without force threaded interrupts.

For a quick fix provide a wrapper around generic_handle_irq() which has a
local_irq_save/restore() around the invocation and use it in the i2c code.
