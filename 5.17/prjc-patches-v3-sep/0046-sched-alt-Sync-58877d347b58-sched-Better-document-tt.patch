+ * Serialization rules:
+ *
+ * Lock order:
+ *
+ *   p->pi_lock
+ *     rq->lock
+ *       hrtimer_cpu_base->lock (hrtimer_start() for bandwidth controls)
+ *
+ *  rq1->lock
+ *    rq2->lock  where: rq1 < rq2
+ *
+ * Regular state:
+ *
+ * Normal scheduling state is serialized by rq->lock. __schedule() takes the
+ * local CPU's rq->lock, it optionally removes the task from the runqueue and
+ * always looks at the local rq data structures to find the most elegible task
+ * to run next.
+ *
+ * Task enqueue is also under rq->lock, possibly taken from another CPU.
+ * Wakeups from another LLC domain might use an IPI to transfer the enqueue to
+ * the local CPU to avoid bouncing the runqueue state around [ see
+ * ttwu_queue_wakelist() ]
+ *
+ * Task wakeup, specifically wakeups that involve migration, are horribly
+ * complicated to avoid having to take two rq->locks.
+ *
+ * Special state:
+ *
+ * System-calls and anything external will use task_rq_lock() which acquires
+ * both p->pi_lock and rq->lock. As a consequence the state they change is
+ * stable while holding either lock:
+ *
+ *  - sched_setaffinity()/
+ *    set_cpus_allowed_ptr():	p->cpus_ptr, p->nr_cpus_allowed
+ *  - set_user_nice():		p->se.load, p->*prio
+ *  - __sched_setscheduler():	p->sched_class, p->policy, p->*prio,
+ *				p->se.load, p->rt_priority,
+ *				p->dl.dl_{runtime, deadline, period, flags, bw, density}
+ *  - sched_setnuma():		p->numa_preferred_nid
+ *  - sched_move_task()/
+ *    cpu_cgroup_fork():	p->sched_task_group
+ *  - uclamp_update_active()	p->uclamp*
+ *
+ * p->state <- TASK_*:
+ *
+ *   is changed locklessly using set_current_state(), __set_current_state() or
+ *   set_special_state(), see their respective comments, or by
+ *   try_to_wake_up(). This latter uses p->pi_lock to serialize against
+ *   concurrent self.
+ *
+ * p->on_rq <- { 0, 1 = TASK_ON_RQ_QUEUED, 2 = TASK_ON_RQ_MIGRATING }:
+ *
+ *   is set by activate_task() and cleared by deactivate_task(), under
+ *   rq->lock. Non-zero indicates the task is runnable, the special
+ *   ON_RQ_MIGRATING state is used for migration without holding both
+ *   rq->locks. It indicates task_cpu() is not stable, see task_rq_lock().
+ *
+ * p->on_cpu <- { 0, 1 }:
+ *
+ *   is set by prepare_task() and cleared by finish_task() such that it will be
+ *   set before p is scheduled-in and cleared after p is scheduled-out, both
+ *   under rq->lock. Non-zero indicates the task is running on its CPU.
+ *
+ *   [ The astute reader will observe that it is possible for two tasks on one
+ *     CPU to have ->on_cpu = 1 at the same time. ]
+ *
+ * task_cpu(p): is changed by set_task_cpu(), the rules are:
+ *
+ *  - Don't call set_task_cpu() on a blocked task:
+ *
+ *    We don't care what CPU we're not running on, this simplifies hotplug,
+ *    the CPU assignment of blocked tasks isn't required to be valid.
+ *
+ *  - for try_to_wake_up(), called under p->pi_lock:
+ *
+ *    This allows try_to_wake_up() to only take one rq->lock, see its comment.
+ *
+ *  - for migration called under rq->lock:
+ *    [ see task_on_rq_migrating() in task_rq_lock() ]
+ *
+ *    o move_queued_task()
+ *    o detach_task()
+ *
+ *  - for migration called under double_rq_lock():
+ *
+ *    o __migrate_swap_task()
+ *    o push_rt_task() / pull_rt_task()
+ *    o push_dl_task() / pull_dl_task()
+ *    o dl_task_offline_migration()
