Subject: [PATCH 33/33] btrfs: fix hang during unmount when block group reclaim
 task is running

When we start an unmount, at close_ctree(), if we have the reclaim task
running and in the middle of a data block group relocation, we can trigger
a deadlock when stopping an async reclaim task, producing a trace like the
following:

This happens because:

1) Before entering close_ctree() we have the async block group reclaim
   task running and relocating a data block group;

2) There's an async metadata (or data) space reclaim task running;

3) We enter close_ctree() and park the cleaner kthread;

4) The async space reclaim task is at flush_space() and runs all the
   existing delayed iputs;

5) Before the async space reclaim task calls
   btrfs_wait_on_delayed_iputs(), the block group reclaim task which is
   doing the data block group relocation, creates a delayed iput at
   replace_file_extents() (called when COWing leaves that have file extent
   items pointing to relocated data extents, during the merging phase
   of relocation roots);

6) The async reclaim space reclaim task blocks at
   btrfs_wait_on_delayed_iputs(), since we have a new delayed iput;

7) The task at close_ctree() then calls cancel_work_sync() to stop the
   async space reclaim task, but it blocks since that task is waiting for
   the delayed iput to be run;

8) The delayed iput is never run because the cleaner kthread is parked,
   and no one else runs delayed iputs, resulting in a hang.

So fix this by stopping the async block group reclaim task before we
park the cleaner kthread.
