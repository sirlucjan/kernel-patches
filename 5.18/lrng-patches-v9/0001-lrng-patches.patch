Subject: [PATCH 01/34] crypto: Entropy Source and DRNG Manager

The kernel crypto API contains deterministic random number generators
(DRNG) which a caller must seed and reseed. The task of seeding a DRNG
is a non-trivial task requiring the consideration of a significant
number of aspects. The Entropy Source and DRNG Manager (ESDM) fills
that gap to transparently seed and reseed DRNGs. A user of the ESDM
obtains random numbers from an appropriately seeded and initialized
DRNG. Further, the ESDM controls various entropy sources guaranteeing
that they are properly initialized and managed.

The ESDM consists of two main parts:

- The entropy source (ES) manager implemented in lrng_es_mgr.c
  controls the available entropy sources including pulling appropritate
  amount of data from them for the DRNG manager.

- The DRNG manager provided with lrng_drng_mgr.c controls the DRNG(s)
  and ensures proper seeding and reseeding.

The entropy source manager controls the entropy sources registered in
the lrng_es array. The entropy sources provide a function pointer data
structure that is used to obtain the services from it.

The ES manager triggers the initial seeding of the DRNGs during boot
time in three stages:

1. The DRNG is seeded from the entropy sources if all entropy sources
   collectively have at least 32 bits of entropy available. The goal
   of this step is to ensure that the DRNG receive some initial entropy
   as early as possible.

2. The DRNG is reseeded from the entropy sources if all entropy sources
   collectively have at least 128 bits of entropy available.

3. The DRNG is reseeded from the entropy sources if all entropy sources
   collectively have at least 256 bits of entropy available.

At the time of the reseeding steps, the DRNG requests as much entropy as
is available in order to skip certain steps and reach the seeding level
of 256 bits. This may imply that one or more of the aforementioned steps
are skipped.

In all listed steps, the DRNG is (re)seeded with a number of random bytes
from the entropy pool that is at most the amount of entropy present in
the entropy pool. This means that for example when the entropy pool
contains 128 or more bits of entropy, the DRNG is seeded with that amount
of entropy as well.

Entropy sources (ES) inform the ES manager when new entropy has been
collected using the lrng_es_add_entropy() function. That function
schedules a DRNG (re)seed with the DRNG manager. When the DRNG manager
requests entropy data, the function lrng_fill_seed_buffer fills the seed
buffer by iterating through all available ES. The output of all entropy
sources is concatenated with each other. Further, the seed buffer
contains the amount of entropy each entropy credits its data. Finally a
time stamp is added.

The ES trigger such (re)seeding events only as long as not all DRNGs
are fully seeded with 256 bits of entropy. Once that seeding level is
reached, the triggers are not further processed.

The DRNG manager initializes the initial DRNG instance during late stage
of the kernel boot process before user space is triggered. The DRNG is
seeded at the following occasions:

- when the DRNG is initialized, the available amount of entropy is used,

- during boot time until the DRNG is fully initialized, the reaching of
  the aforementioned seeding steps of 32/128/256 bits of entropy trigger
  a reseed of the DRNG.

- at runtime after the elapse of 600 seconds since the last seeding,
  the DRNG reseeding flag is raised

- at runtime when more than 2^20 generate operations were performed by
  the given DRNG since last reseeding, the reseeding flag is raised

Raising the reseeding flag implies that the DRNG is seeded in process
context the next time a caller requests random numbers.

At runtime, the DRNG manager requires at least 128 bits of entropy from
the entropy sources (or 256 bits when the FIPS mode is active to be
SP800-90C compliant). It may be possible that the entropy sources may
not deliver that amount. The DRNG is reseeded with the available amount
of entropy and continues to operate. Yet, when after 2^30 generate
requests since the last seeding with 128 bits (or 256 bits in FIPS mode)
the DRNG cannot be seeded with 128 bits (or 256 bits), the DRNG becomes
unseeded which means it will not produce random numbers until it is
fully reseeded again.

To support the DRNG manager, a DRNG implementation is provided with
lrng_drng_kcapi.c. It uses the kernel crypto API RNG framework and
allows the specification of the used DRNG with the kernel command line
option of lrng_drng_kcapi.drng_name. If no reference is given, the
default is the SP800-90A DRBG. In case the chosen DRNG requires the seed
to have a certain length, a hash is used bring the entropy buffer into
the proper size.

In addition, the DRNG manager controls the message digest implementation
offered to entropy sources when they want to perform a conditioning
operation. As entropy sources may require the conditioning operation at
any time, the default is a SHA-256 software hash implementation that
neither sleeps nor does it need any memory allocation operation.
Therefore, this hash is available even for the earliest kernel
operations.

The initial drop of the ESDM includes the entropy source of the
"auxiliary" pool. This entropy source must always be present. It is an
entropy pool that is based on the state of a message digest. Every
insertion of data is a hash update operation. In order to obtain data, a
hash final operation is performed. The purpose of this auxiliary pool is
twofold:

- Provide a general interface to inject an arbitrary amount of data from
  any external source. When providing such data, the caller may specify
  the amount of entropy it contains.

- The auxiliary pool also provides the backtracking resistance for all
  entropy sources. Once a seed buffer is filled from all entropy sources
  it is re-inserted into the auxiliary pool at the same time it is used
  for seeding the DRNG. Naturally, the insertion of the seed buffer into
  the auxiliary pool is not credited with any entropy.

If enabled during compile time with the option of
CONFIG_CRYPTO_ESDM_OVERSAMPLE_ENTROPY_SOURCES, the entropy source
oversampling is activated. However, this oversampling is only enforced
if the kernel is booted with fips=1. The oversampling pulls 128 more
bits of entropy than originally requested. This implies that when 256
bits of entropy are requested for a (re)seed of a DRNG, the ES are
queried for 384 bits. This oversampling complies with SP800-90C.

This patch set contains a number of header files for subsequent
additions, but with the current Kconfig settings, these additional
settings will be folded to noops.

Subject: [PATCH 02/34] LRNG - allocate one DRNG instance per NUMA node

In order to improve NUMA-locality when serving getrandom(2) requests,
allocate one DRNG instance per node.

The DRNG instance that is present right from the start of the kernel is
reused as the first per-NUMA-node DRNG. For all remaining online NUMA
nodes a new DRNG instance is allocated.

During boot time, the multiple DRNG instances are seeded sequentially.
With this, the first DRNG instance (referenced as the initial DRNG
in the code) is completely seeded with 256 bits of entropy before the
next DRNG instance is completely seeded.

When random numbers are requested, the NUMA-node-local DRNG is checked
whether it has been already fully seeded. If this is not the case, the
initial DRNG is used to serve the request.

Subject: [PATCH 03/34] LRNG - /proc interface

The patch adds the file lrng_type which provides details about
the LRNG:

- the name of the DRNG that produces the random numbers for /dev/random,
/dev/urandom, getrandom(2)

- the hash used to produce random numbers from the entropy pool

- the number of secondary DRNG instances

- indicator whether the LRNG operates SP800-90B compliant

- indicator whether a high-resolution timer is identified - only with a
high-resolution timer the interrupt noise source will deliver sufficient
entropy

- indicator whether the LRNG has been minimally seeded (i.e. is the
secondary DRNG seeded with at least 128 bits of entropy)

- indicator whether the LRNG has been fully seeded (i.e. is the
secondary DRNG seeded with at least 256 bits of entropy)

include/linux/lrng.h. A new DRNG is implemented by filling in the
interface defined in this header file.

In addition to the DRNG, the extension also has to provide a hash
implementation that is used to hash the entropy pool for random number
extraction.

Note: It is permissible to implement a DRNG whose operations may sleep.
However, the hash function must not sleep.

The switchable DRNG support allows replacing the DRNG at runtime.
However, only one DRNG extension is allowed to be loaded at any given
time. Before replacing it with another DRNG implementation, the possibly
existing DRNG extension must be unloaded.

The switchable DRNG extension activates the new DRNG during load time.
It is expected, however, that such a DRNG switch would be done only once
by an administrator to load the intended DRNG implementation.

It is permissible to compile DRNG extensions either as kernel modules or
statically. The initialization of the DRNG extension should be performed
with a late_initcall to ensure the extension is available when user
space starts but after all other initialization completed.
The initialization is performed by registering the function call data
structure with the lrng_set_drng_cb function. In order to unload the
DRNG extension, lrng_set_drng_cb must be invoked with the NULL
parameter.

The DRNG extension should always provide a security strength that is at
least as strong as LRNG_DRNG_SECURITY_STRENGTH_BITS.

The hash extension must not sleep and must not maintain a separate
state.

Subject: [PATCH 05/34] LRNG - add common generic hash support

The LRNG switchable DRNG support also allows the replacement of the hash
implementation used as conditioning component. The common generic hash
support code provides the required callbacks using the synchronous hash
implementations of the kernel crypto API.

All synchronous hash implementations supported by the kernel crypto API
can be used as part of the LRNG with this generic support.

Subject: [PATCH 07/34] LRNG - add SP800-90A DRBG extension

Using the LRNG switchable DRNG support, the SP800-90A DRBG extension is
implemented.

The DRBG uses the kernel crypto API DRBG implementation. In addition, it
uses the kernel crypto API SHASH support to provide the hashing
operation.

The DRBG supports the choice of either a CTR DRBG using AES-256, HMAC
DRBG with SHA-512 core or Hash DRBG with SHA-512 core. The used core can
be selected with the module parameter lrng_drbg_type. The default is the
CTR DRBG.

When compiling the DRBG extension statically, the DRBG is loaded at
late_initcall stage which implies that with the start of user space, the
user space interfaces of getrandom(2), /dev/random and /dev/urandom
provide random data produced by an SP800-90A DRBG.

Subject: [PATCH 08/34] LRNG - add kernel crypto API PRNG extension

Add runtime-pluggable support for all PRNGs that are accessible via
the kernel crypto API, including hardware PRNGs. The PRNG is selected
with the module parameter drng_name where the name must be one that the
kernel crypto API can resolve into an RNG.

This allows using of the kernel crypto API PRNG implementations that
provide an interface to hardware PRNGs. Using this extension,
the LRNG uses the hardware PRNGs to generate random numbers. An
example is the S390 CPACF support providing such a PRNG.

The hash is provided by a kernel crypto API SHASH whose digest size
complies with the seedsize of the PRNG.

Subject: [PATCH 09/34] LRNG - add atomic DRNG implementation

The atomic DRNG implementation supports the in-kernel use cases which
request random numbers in atomic contexts. It uses the ChaCha20 DRNG
which is a code base that does not sleep and it provides an interface to
callers that does not sleep. This code will only be compiled when the
LRNG enables the in-kernel drop-in replacement APIs for the existing
random.c code base.

Subject: [PATCH 10/34] LRNG - add common timer-based entropy source code

The code shared for timer-based entropy sources offers the following
support:

* It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) during startup time.
  This allows diving the time stamp by this divisor to eliminate static
  low-order bits. With the GCD only timer bits that move are considered
  by the entropy sources.

* It contains the detector code base to identify the presence of a
  high-resolution timer.

This code is only compiled when an entropy source is present that
is based on high-resolution time stamps

Subject: [PATCH 11/34] LRNG - add interrupt entropy source

The interrupt entropy source (ES) consumes the events triggered by the
kernel invoked with the add_interrupt_randomness. Its main goal is:

- to be extremely fast in the interrupt handler - This is guaranteed by
  only concatenating the least significant bits of a time stamp into
  CPU-local entropy pools. Thus, the operation is quasi-lockless. Also,
  the concatenation is a very trivial operation. Finally, by discarding
  the high-order bits, attacker-observable timing values are discarded.

- to use only cryptographic primitives for compression.

The IRQ entropy pool collects noise data from interrupt timing.
Any data received by the LRNG from the interrupt noise sources is
inserted into a per-CPU entropy pool using a hash operation that can
be changed during runtime. Per default, SHA-256 is used.

 (a) When an interrupt occurs, the 8 least significant bits of the
 high-resolution time stamp divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD)
 is mixed into the per-CPU entropy pool. This time stamp is credited with
 heuristically implied entropy.

 (b) HID event data like the key stroke or the mouse coordinates are
 mixed into the per-CPU entropy pool. This data is not credited with
 entropy by the LRNG.

To speed up the interrupt handling code of the LRNG, the time stamp
collected for an interrupt event is divided by the greatest common
divisor to eliminate fixed low bits and then truncated to the 8 least
significant bits. 1024 truncated time stamps are concatenated and then
jointly inserted into the per-CPU entropy pool. During boot time,
until the fully seeded stage is reached, each time stamp with its
32 least significant bits is are concatenated. When 1024/32 = 32 such
events are received, they are injected into the per-CPU entropy pool.

The IRQ ES is only enabled if the existing random number generator
(random.c) is not compiled.

Subject: [PATCH 12/34] scheduler - add entropy sampling hook

The scheduler can be used as a source of entropy. This requires the
presence of a hook that invokes the entropy source implementation.

When the scheduler-based entropy source is not compiled, the hook is
folded into a noop which does not affect the scheduler in any way.

Subject: [PATCH 13/34] LRNG - add scheduler-based entropy source

The scheduler-based entropy source (ES) consumes the events triggered by
the kernel invoked with the add_sched_randomness. Its main goal is:

- to be extremely fast in the scheduler context - This is guaranteed by
  only concatenating the least significant bits of a time stamp into
  CPU-local entropy pools. Thus, the operation is quasi-lockless. Also,
  the concatenation is a very trivial operation. Finally, by discarding
  the high-order bits, attacker-observable timing values are discarded.

- to use only cryptographic primitives for compression.

The scheduler entropy pool collects noise data from context-switch
timing. Any data received by the LRNG from the interrupt noise sources
is inserted into a per-CPU entropy pool using a concatenation operation.
The following processing concept is applied

 (a) When an interrupt occurs, the 8 least significant bits of the
 high-resolution time stamp divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD)
 is mixed into the per-CPU entropy pool. This time stamp is credited with
 heuristically implied entropy.

 (b) Only in process context when a reseed of the DRNG is requested,
 the compression of the entropy pool data is performed using a hash.
 When the entropy pool is full (i.e. sufficient scheduling event data
 is received and yet no compression is performed), the oldest entropy
 pool entries are overwritten with the current entry. Thus, the entropy
 pool acts as a ring buffer.

To speed up the scheduling operation code of the LRNG, the time stamp
collected for an interrupt event is divided by the greatest common
divisor to eliminate fixed low bits and then truncated to the 8 least
significant bits. 1024 truncated time stamps are concatenated and then
jointly inserted into the per-CPU entropy pool. During boot time,
until the fully seeded stage is reached, each time stamp with its
32 least significant bits is are concatenated. When 1024/32 = 32 such
events are received, they are injected into the per-CPU entropy pool.

Considering the possibility that IRQ events cause at the same time
scheduling events (e.g. the IRQ tasklet is executed), only one of those
two entropy sources can ever be configured to deliver entropy. The
respective other ES may deliver data, but never increases the entropy
estimator of the LRNG.

From 60af59e4698a9f0ce3799a9ae5b209949510fc25 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001

Subject: [PATCH 14/34] LRNG - add SP800-90B compliant health tests
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Implement health tests for LRNG's internal entropy sources as mandated
by SP-800-90B. These internal entropy sources (scheduler and IRQ ES)
both rest on high-resolution time stamps as their noise source. The patch
contains the following health tests which are independently enabled and
applied for the mentioned entropy sources.:

- stuck test: The stuck test calculates the first, second and third
  discrete derivative of the time stamp to be processed by the hash
  for the per-CPU entropy pool. Only if all three values are non-zero,
  the received time delta is considered to be non-stuck.

- SP800-90B Repetition Count Test (RCT): The LRNG uses an enhanced
  version of the RCT specified in SP800-90B section 4.4.1. Instead of
  counting identical back-to-back values, the input to the RCT is the
  counting of the stuck values during the processing of received
  interrupt events. The RCT is applied with alpha=2^-30 compliant to
  the recommendation of FIPS 140-2 IG 9.8. During the counting operation,
  the LRNG always calculates the RCT cut-off value of C. If that value
  exceeds the allowed cut-off value, the LRNG will trigger the health
  test failure discussed below. An error is logged to the kernel log
  that such RCT failure occurred. This test is only applied and
  enforced in FIPS mode, i.e. when the kernel compiled with
  CONFIG_CONFIG_FIPS is started with fips=1.

- SP800-90B Adaptive Proportion Test (APT): The LRNG implements the
  APT as defined in SP800-90B section 4.4.2. The applied significance
  level again is alpha=2^-30 compliant to the recommendation of FIPS
  140-2 IG 9.8.

The aforementioned health tests are applied to the first 1,024 time stamps
obtained from interrupt events. In case one error is identified for either
the RCT, or the APT, the collected entropy is invalidated and the
SP800-90B startup health test is restarted.

As long as the SP800-90B startup health test is not completed, all LRNG
random number output interfaces that may block will block and not generate
any data. This implies that only those potentially blocking interfaces are
defined to provide random numbers that are seeded with the interrupt noise
source being SP800-90B compliant. All other output interfaces will not be
affected by the SP800-90B startup test and thus are not considered
SP800-90B compliant.

At runtime, the SP800-90B APT and RCT are applied to each time stamp
generated for a received interrupt. When either the APT and RCT indicates
a noise source failure, the LRNG is reset to a state it has immediately
after boot:

- all entropy counters are set to zero

- the SP800-90B startup tests are re-performed which implies that
getrandom(2) would block again until new entropy was collected

To summarize, the following rules apply:

• SP800-90B compliant output interfaces

  - /dev/random

  - getrandom(2) system call

  -  get_random_bytes kernel-internal interface when being triggered by
     the callback registered with add_random_ready_callback

• SP800-90B non-compliant output interfaces

  - /dev/urandom

  - get_random_bytes kernel-internal interface called directly

  - randomize_page kernel-internal interface

  - get_random_u32 and get_random_u64 kernel-internal interfaces

  - get_random_u32_wait, get_random_u64_wait, get_random_int_wait, and
    get_random_long_wait kernel-internal interfaces

If either the RCT, or the APT health test fails irrespective whether
during initialization or runtime, the following actions occur:

  1. The entropy of the entire entropy pool is invalidated.

  2. All DRNGs are reset which imply that they are treated as being
     not seeded and require a reseed during next invocation.

  3. The SP800-90B startup health test are initiated with all
     implications of the startup tests. That implies that from that point
     on, new events must be observed and its entropy must be inserted into
     the entropy pool before random numbers are calculated from the
     entropy pool.

Further details on the SP800-90B compliance and the availability of all
test tools required to perform all tests mandated by SP800-90B are
provided at [1].

The entire health testing code is compile-time configurable.

The patch provides a CONFIG_BROKEN configuration of the APT / RCT cutoff
values which have a high likelihood to trigger the health test failure.
The BROKEN APT cutoff is set to the exact mean of the expected value if
the time stamps are equally distributed (512 time stamps divided by 16
possible values due to using the 4 LSB of the time stamp). The BROKEN
RCT cutoff value is set to 1 which is likely to be triggered during
regular operation.

Subject: [PATCH 15/34] LRNG - add random.c entropy source support

The random.c implementation can be used as an entropy source by the
LRNG. This support can be enabled at compile time.

The entropy rate can be set at compile time which is only applied:

- once the random.c considers itself fully seeded, and

- the kernel does not operate in FIPS mode (i.e. fips=1 is not set at
  the kernel command line)

If one of these properties is not set, the ES will obtain data, but will
credit it with zero bits of entropy. For the first bullet, it is clear
why it will have zero bits of entropy. But for the second property, this
is set because the random.c is not operating SP800-90B compliant and
thus must be treated to not deliver any entropy in FIPS mode.

Subject: [PATCH 16/34] LRNG - CPU entropy source

Certain CPUs provide instructions giving access to an entropy source
(e.g. RDSEED on Intel/AMD, DARN on POWER, etc.). The LRNG can utilize
the entropy source to seed its DRNG from.

Some CPU entropy sources (e.g. POWER DARN, RISC-V) are defined to
deliver data that does not contain full entropy. In this case, the CPU
is sampled for as much data as needed to obtain the required amount of
entropy. In this case, a compression operation using the set message
digest is applied.

Subject: [PATCH 18/34] LRNG - add Jitter RNG fast noise source

The Jitter RNG fast noise source implemented as part of the kernel
crypto API is queried for 256 bits of entropy at the time the seed
buffer managed by the LRNG is about to be filled.

The default entropy rate is set to 16 bits of entropy per 256 bits of
data. In FIPS mode, the ratio is set to 256 bits of entropy per 256 bits
of data considering that the Jitter RNG passed the NIST ENT validation
to claim full entropy.

Subject: [PATCH 19/34] LRNG - add option to enable runtime entropy rate
 configuration

The entropy rate for the different entropy sources is configured at
compile time. Enabling the option CONFIG_LRNG_RUNTIME_ES_CONFIG allows
the entropy sources' entropy rate to be adjusted at runtime or boot
time. The different options are:

- IRQ ES: lrng_es_irq.irq_entropy

- Scheduler ES: lrng_es_sched.sched_entropy

- CPU ES: lrng_es_cpu.cpu_entropy

- Kernel ES: lrng_es_krng.krng_entropy

- Jitter RNG ES: lrng_es_jent.jent_entropy

The values to be specified there must apply the rationale given for the
different CONFIG_LRNG_*_ENTROPY_RATE kernel configuration options.

Subject: [PATCH 20/34] LRNG - add interface for gathering of raw entropy

The test interface allows a privileged process to capture the raw
unconditioned noise that is collected by the LRNG for statistical
analysis. Such testing allows the analysis how much entropy
the interrupt noise source provides on a given platform.
Extracted noise data is not used to seed the LRNG. This
is a test interface and not appropriate for production systems.
Yet, the interface is considered to be sufficiently secured for
production systems.

The raw entropy collection is provided for the internal entropy sources
under full control of the LRNG: the IRQ ES and the scheduler-based ES.
The test interfaces are only enabled for the given ES if the ES is
enabled itself.

Access to the data is given through the lrng_raw debugfs file. The
data buffer should be multiples of sizeof(u32) to fill the entire
buffer. Using the option lrng_testing.boot_test=1 the raw noise of
the first 1000 entropy events since boot can be sampled.

This test interface allows generating the data required for
analysis whether the LRNG is in compliance with SP800-90B
sections 3.1.3 and 3.1.4.

In addition, the test interface allows gathering of the concatenated raw
entropy data to verify that the concatenation works appropriately.
This includes sampling of the following raw IRQ data:

* high-resolution time stamp obtained for an IRQ event

* Jiffies

* IRQ number

* return instruction pointer

* interrupt register state

* array logic batching the high-resolution time stamp

* a performance monitor of the IRQ ES

The sampling of the following scheduler-based ES data is possible:

* high-resolution time stamp obtained for a context switch event

* the PID of the process scheduled to

* the process' start time value

* the process' context switch numbers value

* a performance monitor of the scheduler-based ES

Also, a testing interface to support ACVT of the hash implementation
is provided. The reason why only hash testing is supported (as
opposed to also provide testing for the DRNG) is the fact that the
LRNG software hash implementation contains glue code that may
warrant testing in addition to the testing of the software ciphers
via the kernel crypto API. Also, for testing the CTR-DRBG, the
underlying AES implementation would need to be tested. However,
such AES test interface cannot be provided by the LRNG as it has no
means to access the AES operation.

If a test interface is not compiled, its code is a noop which has no
impact on the performance.

+
+config LRNG_TEST_CPU_ES_COMPRESSION

+	help
+	  When enabling this option, the CPU ES compression operation

+	  multiplier even when the CPU ES would deliver full entropy.
+	  This allows testing of the compression operation. It
+	  therefore forces to pull more data from the CPU ES
+	  than what may be required.

From 8c05d0a5b077a17274727c97c4aa56f78421c96e Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Stephan Mueller <smueller@chronox.de>

Subject: [PATCH 21/34] LRNG - add power-on and runtime self-tests

Parts of the LRNG are already covered by self-tests, including:

* Self-test of SP800-90A DRBG provided by the Linux kernel crypto API.

* Self-test of the PRNG provided by the Linux kernel crypto API.

* Raw noise source data testing including SP800-90B compliant
  tests when enabling CONFIG_LRNG_HEALTH_TESTS

This patch adds the self-tests for the remaining critical functions of
the LRNG that are essential to maintain entropy and provide
cryptographic strong random numbers. The following self-tests are
implemented:

* Self-test of the time array maintenance. This test verifies whether
the time stamp array management to store multiple values in one integer
implements a concatenation of the data.

* Self-test of the software hash implementation ensures that this
function operates compliant to the FIPS 180-4 specification. The
self-test performs a hash operation of a zeroized per-CPU data array.

* Self-test of the ChaCha20 DRNG is based on the self-tests that are
already present and implemented with the stand-alone user space
ChaCha20 DRNG implementation available at [1]. The self-tests cover
different use cases of the DRNG seeded with known seed data.

The status of the LRNG self-tests is provided with the selftest_status
SysFS file. If the file contains a zero, the self-tests passed. The
value 0xffffffff means that the self-tests were not executed. Any other
value indicates a self-test failure.

The self-test may be compiled to panic the system if the self-test
fails.

All self-tests operate on private state data structures. This implies
that none of the self-tests have any impact on the regular LRNG
operations. This allows the self-tests to be repeated at runtime by
writing anything into the selftest_status SysFS file.

Subject: [PATCH 22/34] LRNG - sysctls and /proc interface

The LRNG sysctl interface provides the same controls as the existing
/dev/random implementation. These sysctls behave identically and are
implemented identically. The goal is to allow a possible merge of the
existing /dev/random implementation with this implementation which
implies that this patch tries have a very close similarity. Yet, all
sysctls are documented at [1].

The sysctl implementation is only enabled if the existing random.c file
is not compiled.

Subject: [PATCH 23/34] LRMG - add drop-in replacement random(4) API

The LRNG is intended to be a full replacement of the existing random.c.
This also includes the providing of a full API and ABI compliant drop-in
replacement of all APIs offered by random.c.

These LRNG interfaces are compiled when the random.c is not compiled
any more.

The LRNG can be registered with the kernel crypto API's random number
generator framework. This offers a random number generator with the name
"lrng" and a priority that is intended to be higher than the existing
RNG implementations.
