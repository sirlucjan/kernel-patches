+	 * whether the current CPU is in an RCU read-side critical section,
+	 * so the tick can report quiescent states even for CPUs looping
+	 * in kernel context.  In contrast, in non-preemptible kernels,
+	 * RCU readers leave no in-memory hints, which means that CPU-bound
+	 * processes executing in kernel context might never report an
+	 * RCU quiescent state.  Therefore, the following code causes
