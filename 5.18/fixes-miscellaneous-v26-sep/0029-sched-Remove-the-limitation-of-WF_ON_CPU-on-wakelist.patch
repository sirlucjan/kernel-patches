Subject: [PATCH 29/36] sched: Remove the limitation of WF_ON_CPU on wakelist
 if wakee cpu is idle

Wakelist can help avoid cache bouncing and offload the overhead of waker
cpu. So far, using wakelist within the same llc only happens on
WF_ON_CPU, and this limitation could be removed to further improve
wakeup performance.

The commit 518cd6234178 ("sched: Only queue remote wakeups when
crossing cache boundaries") disabled queuing tasks on wakelist when
the cpus share llc. This is because, at that time, the scheduler must
send IPIs to do ttwu_queue_wakelist. Nowadays, ttwu_queue_wakelist also
supports TIF_POLLING, so this is not a problem now when the wakee cpu is
in idle polling.

Benefits:
  Queuing the task on idle cpu can help improving performance on waker cpu
  and utilization on wakee cpu, and further improve locality because
  the wakee cpu can handle its own rq. This patch helps improving rt on
  our real java workloads where wakeup happens frequently.

  Consider the normal condition (CPU0 and CPU1 share same llc)
  Before this patch:

         CPU0                                       CPU1

    select_task_rq()                                idle
    rq_lock(CPU1->rq)
    enqueue_task(CPU1->rq)
    notify CPU1 (by sending IPI or CPU1 polling)

                                                    resched()

  After this patch:

         CPU0                                       CPU1

    select_task_rq()                                idle
    add to wakelist of CPU1
    notify CPU1 (by sending IPI or CPU1 polling)

                                                    rq_lock(CPU1->rq)
                                                    enqueue_task(CPU1->rq)
                                                    resched()

  We see CPU0 can finish its work earlier. It only needs to put task to
  wakelist and return.
  While CPU1 is idle, so let itself handle its own runqueue data.

This patch brings no difference about IPI.
  This patch only takes effect when the wakee cpu is:
  1) idle polling
  2) idle not polling

  For 1), there will be no IPI with or without this patch.

  For 2), there will always be an IPI before or after this patch.
  Before this patch: waker cpu will enqueue task and check preempt. Since
  "idle" will be sure to be preempted, waker cpu must send a resched IPI.
  After this patch: waker cpu will put the task to the wakelist of wakee
  cpu, and send an IPI.

Our patch has improvement on schbench, hackbench
and Pipe-based Context Switching of unixbench
when there exists idle cpus,
and no obvious regression on other tests of unixbench.
This can help improve rt in scenes where wakeup happens frequently.
