Subject: [PATCH 100/103] net: tcp: add option to disable TCP simultaneous
 connect

This is modified from Brad Spengler/PaX Team's code in the last public
patch of grsecurity/PaX based on my understanding of the code. Changes
or omissions from the original code are mine and don't reflect the
original grsecurity/PaX code.

TCP simultaneous connect adds a weakness in Linux's implementation of
TCP that allows two clients to connect to each other without either
entering a listening state. The weakness allows an attacker to easily
prevent a client from connecting to a known server provided the source
port for the connection is guessed correctly.

As the weakness could be used to prevent an antivirus or IPS from
fetching updates, or prevent an SSL gateway from fetching a CRL, it
should be eliminated.

This creates a net.ipv4.tcp_simult_connect sysctl that when disabled,
disables TCP simultaneous connect.
