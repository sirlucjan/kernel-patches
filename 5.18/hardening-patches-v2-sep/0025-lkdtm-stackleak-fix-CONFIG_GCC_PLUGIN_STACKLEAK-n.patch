Subject: [PATCH 25/44] lkdtm/stackleak: fix CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK=n

Recent rework broke building LKDTM when CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK=n.
This patch fixes that breakage.

Prior to recent stackleak rework, the LKDTM STACKLEAK_ERASING code could
be built when the kernel was not built with stackleak support, and would
run a test that would almost certainly fail (or pass by sheer cosmic
coincidence), e.g.

| # echo STACKLEAK_ERASING > /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
| lkdtm: Performing direct entry STACKLEAK_ERASING
| lkdtm: checking unused part of the thread stack (15560 bytes)...
| lkdtm: FAIL: the erased part is not found (checked 15560 bytes)
| lkdtm: FAIL: the thread stack is NOT properly erased!
| lkdtm: This is probably expected, since this kernel (5.18.0-rc2 aarch64) was built *without* CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK=y

The recent rework to the test made it more accurate by using helpers
which are only defined when CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK=y, and so when
building LKDTM when CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK=n, we get a build
failure:

| drivers/misc/lkdtm/stackleak.c: In function 'check_stackleak_irqoff':
| drivers/misc/lkdtm/stackleak.c:30:46: error: implicit declaration of function 'stackleak_task_low_bound' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

|       |                                                ^~

|    74 |         poison_high = stackleak_find_top_of_poison(task_stack_low, untracked_high);
|       |                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This patch fixes the issue by not compiling the body of the test when
CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK=n, and replacing this with an unconditional
XFAIL message. This means the pr_expected_config() in
check_stackleak_irqoff() is redundant, and so it is removed.

Where an architecture does not support stackleak, the test will log:

| # echo STACKLEAK_ERASING > /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
| lkdtm: Performing direct entry STACKLEAK_ERASING
| lkdtm: XFAIL: stackleak is not supported on this arch (HAVE_ARCH_STACKLEAK=n)

Where an architectures does support stackleak, but this has not been
compiled in, the test will log:

| # echo STACKLEAK_ERASING > /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
| lkdtm: Performing direct entry STACKLEAK_ERASING
| lkdtm: XFAIL: stackleak is not enabled (CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK=n)

Where stackleak has been compiled in, the test behaves as usual:

| # echo STACKLEAK_ERASING > /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
| lkdtm: Performing direct entry STACKLEAK_ERASING
| lkdtm: stackleak stack usage:
|   high offset: 336 bytes
|   current:     688 bytes
|   lowest:      1232 bytes
|   tracked:     1232 bytes
|   untracked:   672 bytes
|   poisoned:    14136 bytes
|   low offset:  8 bytes
| lkdtm: OK: the rest of the thread stack is properly erased
