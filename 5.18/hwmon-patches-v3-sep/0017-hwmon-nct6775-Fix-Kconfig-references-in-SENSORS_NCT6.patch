Subject: [PATCH 17/20] hwmon: (nct6775) Fix Kconfig references in
 SENSORS_NCT6775_I2C

In the process of renaming some Kconfig symbols during the review
process a couple of updates got omitted.  Make the i2c driver select
the correct dependency (the core module, not the platform driver), and
refer to the intended symbol for the platform driver in its help text.
