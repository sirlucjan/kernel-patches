Subject: [PATCH 4/5] block: fix bio_clone_blkg_association() to associate with
 proper blkcg_gq

Commit d92c370a16cb ("block: really clone the block cgroup in
bio_clone_blkg_association") changed bio_clone_blkg_association() to
just clone bio->bi_blkg reference from source to destination bio. This
is however wrong if the source and destination bios are against
different block devices because struct blkcg_gq is different for each
bdev-blkcg pair. This will result in IOs being accounted (and throttled
as a result) multiple times against the same device (src bdev) while
throttling of the other device (dst bdev) is ignored. In case of BFQ the
inconsistency can even result in crashes in bfq_bic_update_cgroup().
Fix the problem by looking up correct blkcg_gq for the cloned bio.
