Subject: [PATCH 20/35] block, bfq: do not idle if only one group is activated

Now that root group is counted into 'num_groups_with_pending_reqs',
'num_groups_with_pending_reqs > 0' is always true in
bfq_asymmetric_scenario(). Thus change the condition to '> 1'.

On the other hand, this change can enable concurrent sync io if only
one group is activated.
