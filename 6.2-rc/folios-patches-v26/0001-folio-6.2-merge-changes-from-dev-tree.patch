+It's expensive and unreliable! It's better practice to launch workload

 Users can move charges associated with a task along with task migration, that
 is, uncharge task's pages from the old cgroup and charge them to the new cgroup.

+Users could know something more than the kernel for specific types of memory.
+In the case, users could do their own management for the memory and hence
+doesn't want DAMOS bothers that.  Users could limit DAMOS by setting the access
+pattern of the scheme and/or the monitoring regions for the purpose, but that
+can be inefficient in some cases.  In such cases, users could set non-access
+pattern driven filters using files in this directory.
+
+In the beginning, this directory has only one file, ``nr_filters``.  Writing a
+number (``N``) to the file creates the number of child directories named ``0``
+to ``N-1``.  Each directory represents each filter.  The filters are evaluated
+in the numeric order.
+
+Each filter directory contains three files, namely ``type``, ``matcing``, and
+``memcg_path``.  You can write one of two special keywords, ``anon`` for
+anonymous pages, or ``memcg`` for specific memory cgroup filtering.  In case of
+the memory cgroup filtering, you can specify the memory cgroup of the interest
+by writing the path of the memory cgroup from the cgroups mount point to
+``memcg_path`` file.  You can write ``Y`` or ``N`` to ``matching`` file to
+filter out pages that does or does not match to the type, respectively.  Then,
+the scheme's action will not be applied to the pages that specified to be
+filtered out.
+
+For example, below restricts a DAMOS action to be applied to only non-anonymous
+pages of all memory cgroups except ``/having_care_already``.::
+
+    # echo 2 > nr_filters
+    # # filter out anonymous pages
+    echo anon > 0/type

+For easier development of such systems, DAMON provides a feature called DAMOS
+(DAMon-based Operation Schemes) in addition to the monitoring.  Using the
+feature, DAMON users in both kernel and user spaces can do access-aware system
+operations with no code but simple configurations.

+DAMON Maintainer Entry Profile
+==============================
+
+The DAMON subsystem covers the files that listed in 'DATA ACCESS MONITOR'
+section of 'MAINTAINERS' file.
+
+The mailing lists for the subsystem are damon@lists.linux.dev and
+linux-mm@kvack.org.  Patches should be made against the mm-unstable tree [1]_
+whenever possible and posted to the mailing lists.
+
+SCM Trees
+---------
+
+There are multiple Linux trees for DAMON development.  Patches under
+development or testing are queued in damon/next [2]_ by the DAMON maintainer.
+Suffieicntly reviewed patches will be queued in mm-unstable [1]_ by the memory
+management subsystem maintainer.  After more sufficient tests, the patches will
+be queued in mm-stable [3]_ , and finally pull-requested to the mainline by the
+memory management subsystem maintainer.
+
+Note again the patches for review should be made against the mm-unstable
+tree[1] whenever possible.  damon/next is only for preview of others' works in
+progress.
+
+Submit checklist addendum
+-------------------------
+
+When making DAMON changes, you should do below.
+
+- Build changes related outputs including kernel and documents.
+- Ensure the builds introduce no new errors or warnings.
+- Run and ensure no new failures for DAMON selftests [4]_ and kunittests [5]_ .
+
+Further doing below and putting the results will be helpful.
+
+- Run damon-tests/corr [6]_ for normal changes.
+- Run damon-tests/perf [7]_ for performance changes.
+
+Key cycle dates
+---------------
+
+Patches can be sent anytime.  Key cycle dates of the mm-unstable[1] and
+mm-stable[3] trees depend on the memory management subsystem maintainer.
+
+Review cadence
+--------------
+
+The DAMON maintainer does the work on the usual work hour (09:00 to 17:00,
+Mon-Fri) in PST.  The response to patches will occasionally be slow.  Do not
+hesitate to send a ping if you have not heard back within a week of sending a
+patch.
