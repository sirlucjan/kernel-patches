Subject: [PATCH 42/97] nfsd: fix handling of readdir in v4root vs. mount
 upcall timeout

If v4 READDIR operation hits a mountpoint and gets back an error,
then it will include that entry in the reply and set RDATTR_ERROR for it
to the error.

That's fine for "normal" exported filesystems, but on the v4root, we
need to be more careful to only expose the existence of dentries that
lead to exports.

If the mountd upcall times out while checking to see whether a
mountpoint on the v4root is exported, then we have no recourse other
than to fail the whole operation.
