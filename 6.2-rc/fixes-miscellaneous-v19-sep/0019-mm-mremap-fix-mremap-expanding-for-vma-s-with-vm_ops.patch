Subject: [PATCH 19/19] mm, mremap: fix mremap() expanding for vma's with
 vm_ops->close()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Fabian has reported another regression in 6.1 due to ca3d76b0aa80 ("mm:
add merging after mremap resize"). The problem is that vma_merge() can
fail when vma has a vm_ops->close() method, causing is_mergeable_vma()
test to be negative. This was happening for vma mapping a file from
fuse-overlayfs, which does have the method. But when we are simply
expanding the vma, we never remove it due to the "merge" with the added
area, so the test should not prevent the expansion.

As a quick fix, check for such vmas and expand them using vma_adjust()
directly as was done before commit ca3d76b0aa80. For a more robust long
term solution we should try to limit the check for vma_ops->close only
to cases that actually result in vma removal, so that no merge would be
prevented unnecessarily.
