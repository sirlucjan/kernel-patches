 AMD Pstate Driver Operation Modes
 =================================
 
-``amd_pstate`` CPPC has two operation modes: CPPC Autonomous(active) mode and
-CPPC non-autonomous(passive) mode.
-active mode and passive mode can be chosen by different kernel parameters.
-When in Autonomous mode, CPPC ignores requests done in the Desired Performance
-Target register and takes into account only the values set to the Minimum requested
-performance, Maximum requested performance, and Energy Performance Preference
-registers. When Autonomous is disabled, it only considers the Desired Performance Target.
+``amd_pstate`` CPPC has 3 operation modes: autonomous (active) mode, guided
+autonomous (guided) mode and non-autonomous (passive) mode.
+Active/passive/guided mode can be chosen by different kernel parameters. In
+autonomous mode, platform ignores the desired performance level request and
+takes into account only the values set to the Minimum requested performance,
+Maximum requested performance and Energy Performance Preference registers. In
+non-autonomous mode, platform gets desired performance level from OS directly
+through Desired Performance Register. In guided-autonomous mode, platform sets
+operating performance level autonomously according to the current workload and
+within the limits set by OS through min and max performance registers.
