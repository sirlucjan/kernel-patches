Subject: [PATCH 52/58] mm: introduce mod_vm_flags_nolock

In cases when VMA flags are modified after VMA was isolated and mmap_lock
was downgraded, flags modifications do not require per-VMA locking and
an attempt to lock the VMA would result in an assertion because mmap
write lock is not held.
Introduce mod_vm_flags_nolock to be used in such situation.
