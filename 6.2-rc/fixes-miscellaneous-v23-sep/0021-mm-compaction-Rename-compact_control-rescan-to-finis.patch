Subject: [PATCH 21/28] mm, compaction: Rename compact_control->rescan to
 finish_pageblock

The rescan field was not well named albeit accurate at the time. Rename the
field to finish_pageblock to indicate that the remainder of the pageblock
should be scanned regardless of COMPACT_CLUSTER_MAX. The intent is that
pageblocks with transient failures get marked for skipping to avoid
revisiting the same pageblock.
