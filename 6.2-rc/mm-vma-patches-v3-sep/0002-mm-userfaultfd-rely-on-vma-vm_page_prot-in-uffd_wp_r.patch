Subject: [PATCH 002/122] mm/userfaultfd: rely on vma->vm_page_prot in
 uffd_wp_range()

Patch series "mm: uffd-wp + change_protection() cleanups".

Cleanup page protection handling in uffd-wp when calling
change_protection() and improve unprotecting uffd=wp in private mappings,
trying to set PTEs writable again if possible just like we do during
mprotect() when upgrading write permissions.  Make the change_protection()
interface harder to get wrong :)

I consider both pages primarily cleanups, although patch #1 fixes a corner
case with uffd-wp and softdirty tracking for shmem.  @Peter, please let me
know if we should flag patch #1 as pure cleanup -- I have no idea how
important softdirty tracking on shmem is.

This patch (of 2):

uffd_wp_range() currently calculates page protection manually using
vm_get_page_prot().  This will ignore any other reason for active
writenotify: one mechanism applicable to shmem is softdirty tracking.

For example, the following sequence

1) Write to mapped shmem page
2) Clear softdirty
3) Register uffd-wp covering the mapped page
4) Unregister uffd-wp covering the mapped page
5) Write to page again

will not set the modified page softdirty, because uffd_wp_range() will
ignore that writenotify is required for softdirty tracking and simply map
the page writable again using change_protection().  Similarly, instead of
unregistering, protecting followed by un-protecting the page using uffd-wp
would result in the same situation.

Now that we enable writenotify whenever enabling uffd-wp on a VMA,
vma->vm_page_prot will already properly reflect our requirements: the
default is to write-protect all PTEs.  However, for shared mappings we
would now not remap the PTEs writable if possible when unprotecting, just
like for private mappings (COW).  To compensate, set
MM_CP_TRY_CHANGE_WRITABLE just like mprotect() does to try mapping
individual PTEs writable.

For private mappings, this change implies that we will now always try
setting PTEs writable when un-protecting, just like when upgrading write
permissions using mprotect(), which is an improvement.

For shared mappings, we will only set PTEs writable if
can_change_pte_writable()/can_change_pmd_writable() indicates that it's
ok.  For ordinary shmem, this will be the case when PTEs are dirty, which
should usually be the case -- otherwise we could special-case shmem in
can_change_pte_writable()/can_change_pmd_writable() easily, because shmem
itself doesn't require writenotify.

Note that hugetlb does not yet implement MM_CP_TRY_CHANGE_WRITABLE, so we
won't try setting PTEs writable when unprotecting or when unregistering
uffd-wp.  This can be added later on top by implementing
MM_CP_TRY_CHANGE_WRITABLE.

While commit ffd05793963a ("userfaultfd: wp: support write protection for
userfault vma range") introduced that code, it should only be applicable
to uffd-wp on shared mappings -- shmem (hugetlb does not support softdirty
tracking).  I don't think this corner cases justifies to cc stable.  Let's
just handle it correctly and prepare for change_protection() cleanups.
