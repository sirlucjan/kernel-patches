Subject: [PATCH 13/48] maple_tree: fix a few documentation issues

The documentation of mt_next() claims that it starts the search at the
provided index.  That's incorrect as it starts the search after the
provided index.

The documentation of mt_find() is slightly confusing.  "Handles locking"
is not really helpful as it does not explain how the "locking" works.
Also the documentation of index talks about a range, while in reality the
index is updated on a succesful search to the index of the found entry
plus one.

Fix similar issues for mt_find_after() and mt_prev().

Reword the confusing "Note: Will not return the zero entry." comment on
mt_for_each() and document @__index correctly.
