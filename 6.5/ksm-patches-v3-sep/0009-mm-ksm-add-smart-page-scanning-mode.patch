Subject: [PATCH 09/12] mm/ksm: add "smart" page scanning mode

This change adds a "smart" page scanning mode for KSM. So far all the
candidate pages are continuously scanned to find candidates for
de-duplication. There are a considerably number of pages that cannot be
de-duplicated. This is costly in terms of CPU. By using smart scanning
considerable CPU savings can be achieved.

This change takes the history of scanning pages into account and skips
the page scanning of certain pages for a while if de-deduplication for
this page has not been successful in the past.

To do this it introduces two new fields in the ksm_rmap_item structure:
age and skip_age. age, is the KSM age and skip_page is the age for how
long page scanning of this page is skipped. The age field is incremented
each time the page is scanned and the page cannot be de-duplicated.

How often a page is skipped is dependent how often de-duplication has
been tried so far and the number of skips is currently limited to 8.
This value has shown to be effective with different workloads.

The feature is currently disable by default and can be enabled with the
new smart_scan knob.

The feature has shown to be very effective: upt to 25% of the page scans
can be eliminated; the pages_to_scan rate can be reduced by 40 - 50% and
a similar de-duplication rate can be maintained.
