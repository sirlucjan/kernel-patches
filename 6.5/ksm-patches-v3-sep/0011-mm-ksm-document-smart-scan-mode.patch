+        By default KSM checks every candidate page for each scan. It does
+        not take into account historic information. When smart scan is
+        enabled, pages that have previously not been de-duplicated get
+        skipped. How often these pages are skipped depends on how often
+        de-duplication has already been tried and failed. By default this
