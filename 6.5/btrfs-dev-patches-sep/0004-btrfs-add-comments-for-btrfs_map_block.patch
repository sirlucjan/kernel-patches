Subject: [PATCH 004/110] btrfs: add comments for btrfs_map_block()

The function btrfs_map_block() is a critical part of the btrfs storage
layer, which handles mapping of logical ranges to physical ranges.

Thus it's better to have some basic explanation, especially on the
following points:

- Segment split by various boundaries
  As a continuous logical range may be split into different segments,
  due to various factors like zones and RAID0/5/6/10 boundaries.

- The meaning of @mirror_num

- The possible single stripe optimization

- One deprecated parameter @need_raid_map
  Just explicitly mark it deprecated so we're aware of the problem.

+ *
+ * @smap:		(Optional) single physical range optimization.
+ *			If the map request can be fulfilled by one single
+ *			physical range, and this is parameter is not NULL,
+ *			then @bioc_ret would be NULL, and @smap would be
+ *			updated.
+ *
+ * @mirror_num_ret:	(Mandatory) returned mirror number if the original
+ *			value is 0.
+ *
+ *			Mirror number 0 means to choose any live mirrors.
+ *
+ *			For non-RAID56 profiles, non-zero mirror_num means
+ *			the Nth mirror. (e.g. mirror_num 1 means the first
+ *			copy).
+ *
+ *			For RAID56 profile, mirror 1 means rebuild from P and
+ *			the remaining data stripes.
+ *
+ *			For RAID6 profile, mirror > 2 means mark another
+ *			data/P stripe error and rebuild from the remaining
+ *			stripes..
+ *
+ * @need_raid_map:	(Used only for integrity checker) whether the map wants
+ *                      a full stripe map (including all data and P/Q stripes)
+ *                      for RAID56. Should always be 1 except integrity checker.
