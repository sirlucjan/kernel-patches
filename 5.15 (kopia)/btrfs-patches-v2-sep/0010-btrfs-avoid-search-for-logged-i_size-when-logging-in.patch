Subject: [PATCH 10/29] btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging
 inode if possible

If we are logging that an inode exists and the inode was not logged
before, we can avoid searching in the log tree for the inode item since we
know it does not exists. That wastes time and adds more lock contention on
the extent buffers of the log tree when there are other tasks that are
logging other inodes.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists
  btrfs: always update the logged transaction when logging new names
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when dropping inode items from log
  btrfs: add helper to truncate inode items when logging inode
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when truncating inode items from the log
  btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging inode if possible
  btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time
  btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file in full sync mode

This is patch 8/10 and test results are listed in the change log of the
last patch in the set.
