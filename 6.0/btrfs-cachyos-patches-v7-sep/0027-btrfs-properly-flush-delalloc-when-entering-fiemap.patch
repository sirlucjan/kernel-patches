Subject: [PATCH 27/34] btrfs: properly flush delalloc when entering fiemap

If the flag FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC is passed to fiemap, it means all delalloc
should be flushed and writeback complete. We call the generic helper
fiemap_prep() which does a filemap_write_and_wait() in case that flag is
given, however that is not enough if we have compression. Because a
single filemap_fdatawrite_range() only starts compression (in an async
thread) and therefore returns before the compression is done and writeback
is started.

So make btrfs_fiemap(), actually wait for all writeback to start and
complete if FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC is set. We start and wait for writeback
on the whole possible file range, from 0 to LLONG_MAX, because that is
what the generic code at fiemap_prep() does.
