Subject: [PATCH 10/38] leds: trigger: Add block device LED trigger

Add "blkdev" LED trigger to blink LEDs in response to block device
activity.

Add LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV (tristate) config option to control building of
the trigger.

+/**
+ * DOC: Overview
+ *
+ * The ``blkdev`` LED trigger works by periodically checking the activity
+ * counters of block devices that have been linked to one or more LEDs and
+ * blinking those LED(s) if the correct type of activity has occurred.  The
+ * periodic check is scheduled with the Linux kernel's deferred work facility.
+ *
+ * Trigger-specific data about block devices and LEDs is stored in two data
+ * structures --- &struct blkdev_trig_bdev (a "BTB") and &struct blkdev_trig_led
+ * (a "BTL").  Each structure contains a &struct xarray that holds links to any
+ * linked devices of the other type.  I.e. &blkdev_trig_bdev.linked_btls
+ * contains links to all BTLs whose LEDs have been linked to the BTB's block
+ * device, and &blkdev_trig_led.linked_btbs contains links to all BTBs whose
+ * block devices have been linked to the BTL's LED.  Thus, a block device can
+ * be linked to more than one LED, and an LED can be linked to more than one
+ * block device.
