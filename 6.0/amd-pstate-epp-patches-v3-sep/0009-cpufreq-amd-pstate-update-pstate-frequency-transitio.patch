Subject: [PATCH 09/10] cpufreq: amd-pstate: update pstate frequency transition
 delay time

Change the default transition latency to be 20ms that is more
reasonable transition delay for AMD processors in non-EPP driver mode.

Update transition delay time to 1ms, in the AMD CPU autonomous mode and
non-autonomous mode, CPPC firmware will decide frequency at 1ms timescale
based on the workload utilization.
