Subject: [PATCH 31/32] btrfs: skip unnecessary extent buffer sharedness checks
 during fiemap

During fiemap, for each file extent we find, we must check if it's shared
or not. The sharedness check starts by verifying if the extent is directly
shared (its refcount in the extent tree is > 1), and if it is not directly
shared, then we will check if every node in the subvolume b+tree leading
from the root to the leaf that has the file extent item (in reverse order),
is shared (through snapshots).

However this second step is not needed if our extent was created in a
transaction more recent than the last transaction where a snapshot of the
inode's root happened, because it can't be shared indirectly (through
shared subtrees) without a snapshot created in a more recent transaction.

So grab the generation of the extent from the extent map and pass it to
btrfs_is_data_extent_shared(), which will skip this second phase when the
generation is more recent than the root's last snapshot value. Note that
we skip this optimization if the extent map is the result of merging 2
or more extent maps, because in this case its generation is the maximum
of the generations of all merged extent maps.

The fact the we use extent maps and they can be merged despite the
underlying extents being distinct (different file extent items in the
subvolume b+tree and different extent items in the extent b+tree), can
result in some bugs when reporting shared extents. But this is a problem
of the current implementation of fiemap relying on extent maps.
One example where we get incorrect results is:

    $ cat fiemap-bug.sh
    #!/bin/bash

    DEV=/dev/sdj
    MNT=/mnt/sdj

    mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
    mount $DEV $MNT

    # Create a file with two 256K extents.
    # Since there is no other write activity, they will be contiguous,
    # and their extent maps merged, despite having two distinct extents.
    xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xab 0 256K" \
              -c "fsync" \
              -c "pwrite -S 0xcd 256K 256K" \
              -c "fsync" \
              $MNT/foo

    # Now clone only the second extent into another file.
    xfs_io -f -c "reflink $MNT/foo 256K 0 256K" $MNT/bar

    # Filefrag will report a single 512K extent, and say it's not shared.
    echo
    filefrag -v $MNT/foo

    umount $MNT

Running the reproducer:

    $ ./fiemap-bug.sh
    wrote 262144/262144 bytes at offset 0
    256 KiB, 64 ops; 0.0038 sec (65.479 MiB/sec and 16762.7030 ops/sec)
    wrote 262144/262144 bytes at offset 262144
    256 KiB, 64 ops; 0.0040 sec (61.125 MiB/sec and 15647.9218 ops/sec)
    linked 262144/262144 bytes at offset 0
    256 KiB, 1 ops; 0.0002 sec (1.034 GiB/sec and 4237.2881 ops/sec)

    Filesystem type is: 9123683e
    File size of /mnt/sdj/foo is 524288 (128 blocks of 4096 bytes)
     ext:     logical_offset:        physical_offset: length:   expected: flags:
       0:        0..     127:       3328..      3455:    128:             last,eof
    /mnt/sdj/foo: 1 extent found

We end up reporting that we have a single 512K that is not shared, however
we have two 256K extents, and the second one is shared. Changing the
reproducer to clone instead the first extent into file 'bar', makes us
report a single 512K extent that is shared, which is algo incorrect since
we have two 256K extents and only the first one is shared.

This is z problem that existed before this change, and remains after this
change, as it can't be easily fixed. The next patch in the series reworks
fiemap to primarily use file extent items instead of extent maps (except
for checking for delalloc ranges), with the goal of improving its
scalability and performance, but it also ends up fixing this particular
bug caused by extent map merging.
