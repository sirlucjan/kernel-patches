Subject: [PATCH 1/5] mm: rewrite wait_on_page_bit_common() logic

It turns out that wait_on_page_bit_common() had several problems,
ranging from just unfair behavioe due to re-queueing at the end of the
wait queue when re-trying, and an outright bug that could result in
missed wakeups (but probably never happened in practice).

This rewrites the whole logic to avoid both issues, by simply moving the
logic to check (and possibly take) the bit lock into the wakeup path
instead.

That makes everything much more straightforward, and means that we never
need to re-queue the wait entry: if we get woken up, we'll be notified
through WQ_FLAG_WOKEN, and the wait queue entry will have been removed,
and everything will have been done for us.

ra.mmap_miss is used to contribute the readahead decisions, a data race
could be undesirable.  Both the read and write is only under non-exclusive
mmap_sem, two concurrent writers could even underflow the counter.  Fix
the underflow by writing to a local variable before committing a final
store to ra.mmap_miss given a small inaccuracy of the counter should be
acceptable.

Subject: [PATCH 5/5] mm: allow a controlled amount of unfairness in the page
 lock

Commit 2a9127fcf229 ("mm: rewrite wait_on_page_bit_common() logic") made
the page locking entirely fair, in that if a waiter came in while the
lock was held, the lock would be transferred to the lockers strictly in
order.

That was intended to finally get rid of the long-reported watchdog
failures that involved the page lock under extreme load, where a process
could end up waiting essentially forever, as other page lockers stole
the lock from under it.

It also improved some benchmarks, but it ended up causing huge
performance regressions on others, simply because fair lock behavior
doesn't end up giving out the lock as aggressively, causing better
worst-case latency, but potentially much worse average latencies and
throughput.

Instead of reverting that change entirely, this introduces a controlled
amount of unfairness, with a sysctl knob to tune it if somebody needs
to.  But the default value should hopefully be good for any normal load,
allowing a few rounds of lock stealing, but enforcing the strict
ordering before the lock has been stolen too many times.

There is also a hint from Matthieu Baerts that the fair page coloring
may end up exposing an ABBA deadlock that is hidden by the usual
optimistic lock stealing, and while the unfairness doesn't fix the
fundamental issue (and I'm still looking at that), it avoids it in
practice.

The amount of unfairness can be modified by writing a new value to the
'sysctl_page_lock_unfairness' variable (default value of 5, exposed
through /proc/sys/vm/page_lock_unfairness), but that is hopefully
something we'd use mainly for debugging rather than being necessary for
any deep system tuning.

This whole issue has exposed just how critical the page lock can be, and
how contended it gets under certain locks.  And the main contention
doesn't really seem to be anything related to IO (which was the origin
of this lock), but for things like just verifying that the page file
mapping is stable while faulting in the page into a page table.

+ * The page wait code treats the "wait->flags" somewhat unusually, because

+ * one.
+ *
+ * We have:
+ *
+ *  (a) no special bits set:
+ *
+ *	We're just waiting for the bit to be released, and when a waker
+ *	calls the wakeup function, we set WQ_FLAG_WOKEN and wake it up,
+ *	and remove it from the wait queue.
+ *
+ *	Simple and straightforward.
+ *
+ *  (b) WQ_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE:
+ *
+ *	The waiter is waiting to get the lock, and only one waiter should
+ *	be woken up to avoid any thundering herd behavior. We'll set the
+ *	WQ_FLAG_WOKEN bit, wake it up, and remove it from the wait queue.
+ *
+ *	This is the traditional exclusive wait.
+ *
+ *  (b) WQ_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE | WQ_FLAG_CUSTOM:
+ *
+ *	The waiter is waiting to get the bit, and additionally wants the
+ *	lock to be transferred to it for fair lock behavior. If the lock
+ *	cannot be taken, we stop walking the wait queue without waking
+ *	the waiter.
+ *
+ *	This is the "fair lock handoff" case, and in addition to setting
+ *	WQ_FLAG_WOKEN, we set WQ_FLAG_DONE to let the waiter easily see
+ *	that it now has the lock.
