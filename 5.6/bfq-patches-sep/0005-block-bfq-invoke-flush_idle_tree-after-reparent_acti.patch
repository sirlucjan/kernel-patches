Subject: [PATCH 5/5] block, bfq: invoke flush_idle_tree after
 reparent_active_queues in pd_offline

In bfq_pd_offline(), the function bfq_flush_idle_tree() is invoked to
flush the rb tree that contains all idle entities belonging to the pd
(cgroup) being destroyed. In particular, bfq_flush_idle_tree() is
invoked before bfq_reparent_active_queues(). Yet the latter may happen
to add some entities to the idle tree. It happens if, in some of the
calls to bfq_bfqq_move() performed by bfq_reparent_active_queues(),
the queue to move is empty and gets expired.

This commit simply reverses the invocation order between
bfq_flush_idle_tree() and bfq_reparent_active_queues().
