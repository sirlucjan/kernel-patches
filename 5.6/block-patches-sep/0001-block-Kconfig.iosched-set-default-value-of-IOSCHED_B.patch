Subject: [PATCH 1/3] block, Kconfig.iosched: set default value of IOSCHED_BFQ
 to yes

When I added bfq to Kconfig.iosched, I forgot to add the line that
sets to yes the default value of IOSCHED_BFQ, as it is the case for
the other two I/O schedulers. Such a piece of information is used by
popular build systems, when making kernel configs automatically. So,
the lack of this line for bfq makes it hard and confusing to have bfq
in the kernel generated by these systems.

This commit adds this missing line.
