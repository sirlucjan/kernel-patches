Subject: [PATCH 1/4] kbuild: Add support for Clang's polyhedral loop
 optimizer.

Polly is able to optimize various loops throughout the kernel for cache
locality. A mathematical representation of the program, based on
polyhedra, is analysed to find opportunistic optimisations in memory
access patterns which then leads to loop transformations.

Polly is not built with LLVM by default, and requires LLVM to be compiled
with the Polly "project". This can be done by adding Polly to
-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS, for example:

-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;libcxx;libcxxabi;polly"

Preliminary benchmarking seems to show an improvement of around two
percent across perf benchmarks:

Benchmark                         | Control    | Polly
--------------------------------------------------------
bonnie++ -x 2 -s 4096 -r 0        | 12.610s    | 12.547s
perf bench futex requeue          | 33.553s    | 33.094s
perf bench futex wake             |  1.032s    |  1.021s
perf bench futex wake-parallel    |  1.049s    |  1.025s
perf bench futex requeue          |  1.037s    |  1.020s

Furthermore, Polly does not produce a much larger image size netting it
to be a "free" optimisation. A comparison of a bzImage for a kernel with
and without Polly is shown below:

bzImage        | stat --printf="%s\n"
-------------------------------------
Control        | 9333728
Polly          | 9345792

Compile times were one percent different at best, which is well within
the range of noise. Therefore, I can say with certainty that Polly has
a minimal effect on compile times, if none.
