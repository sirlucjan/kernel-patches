Subject: [PATCH 34/35] btrfs: do not error out if the extent ref hash doesn't
 match
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The tree checker checks the extent ref hash at read and write time to
make sure we do not corrupt the file system.  Generally extent
references go inline, but if we have enough of them we need to make an
item, which looks like

key.objectid	= <bytenr>
key.type	= <BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_REF_KEY|BTRFS_TREE_BLOCK_REF_KEY>
key.offset	= hash(tree, owner, offset)

However if key.offset collide with an unrelated extent reference we'll
simply key.offset++ until we get something that doesn't collide.
Obviously this doesn't match at tree checker time, and thus we error
while writing out the transaction.  This is relatively easy to
reproduce, simply do something like the following

xfs_io -f -c "pwrite 0 1M" file
offset=2

for i in {0..10000}
do
	xfs_io -c "reflink file 0 ${offset}M 1M" file
	offset=$(( offset + 2 ))
done

xfs_io -c "reflink file 0 17999258914816 1M" file
xfs_io -c "reflink file 0 35998517829632 1M" file
xfs_io -c "reflink file 0 53752752058368 1M" file

btrfs filesystem sync

And the sync will error out because we'll abort the transaction.  The
magic values above are used because they generate hash collisions with
the first file in the main subvol.

The fix for this is to remove the hash value check from tree checker, as
we have no idea which offset ours should belong to.
