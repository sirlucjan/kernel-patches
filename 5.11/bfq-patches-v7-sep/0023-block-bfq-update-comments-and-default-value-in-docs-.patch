Subject: [PATCH 23/39] block/bfq: update comments and default value in docs
 for fifo_expire

Correct the comments since bfq_fifo_expire[0] is for async request,
while bfq_fifo_expire[1] is for sync request.
Also update docs, according the source code, the default
fifo_expire_async is 250ms, and fifo_expire_sync is 125ms.
