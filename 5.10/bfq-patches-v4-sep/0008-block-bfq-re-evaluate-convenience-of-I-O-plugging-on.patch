Subject: [PATCH 08/27] block, bfq: re-evaluate convenience of I/O plugging on
 rq arrivals

Upon an I/O-dispatch attempt, BFQ may detect that it was better to
plug I/O dispatch, and to wait for a new request to arrive for the
currently in-service queue. But the arrival of a new request for an
empty bfq_queue, and thus the switch from idle to busy of the
bfq_queue, may cause the scenario to change, and make plugging no
longer needed for service guarantees, or more convenient for
throughput. In this case, keeping I/O-dispatch plugged would certainly
lower throughput.

To address this issue, this commit makes such a check, and stops
plugging I/O if it is better to stop plugging I/O.
