Subject: [PATCH 18/21] mm: Add become_kswapd and restore_kswapd

Since XFS needs to pretend to be kswapd in some of its worker threads,
create methods to save & restore kswapd state.  Don't bother restoring
kswapd state in kswapd -- the only time we reach this code is when we're
exiting and the task_struct is about to be destroyed anyway.
