Subject: [PATCH 11/37] btrfs: do not block inode logging for so long during
 transaction commit

Early on during a transaction commit we acquire the tree_log_mutex and
hold it until after we write the super blocks. But before writing the
extent buffers dirtied by the transaction and the super blocks we unblock
the transaction by setting its state to TRANS_STATE_UNBLOCKED and setting
fs_info->running_transaction to NULL.

This means that after that and before writing the super blocks, new
transactions can start. However if any transaction wants to log an inode,
it will block waiting for the transaction commit to write its dirty
extent buffers and the super blocks because the tree_log_mutex is only
released after those operations are complete, and starting a new log
transaction blocks on that mutex (at start_log_trans()).

Writing the dirty extent buffers and the super blocks can take a very
significant amount of time to complete, but we could allow the tasks
wanting to log an inode to proceed with most of their steps:

1) create the log trees
2) log metadata in the trees
3) write their dirty extent buffers

They only need to wait for the previous transaction commit to complete
(write its super blocks) before they attempt to write their super blocks,
otherwise we could end up with a corrupt filesystem after a crash

So change start_log_trans() to use the root tree's log_mutex to serialize
for the creation of the log root tree instead of using the tree_log_mutex,
and make btrfs_sync_log() acquire the tree_log_mutex before writing the
super blocks. This allows for inode logging to wait much less time when
there is a previous transaction that is still committing, often not having
to wait at all, as by the time when we try to sync the log the previous
transaction already wrote its super blocks.

This patch belongs to a patch set that is comprised of the following
patches:

  btrfs: fix race causing unnecessary inode logging during link and rename
  btrfs: fix race that results in logging old extents during a fast fsync
  btrfs: fix race that causes unnecessary logging of ancestor inodes
  btrfs: fix race that makes inode logging fallback to transaction commit
  btrfs: fix race leading to unnecessary transaction commit when logging inode
  btrfs: do not block inode logging for so long during transaction commit

The following script that uses dbench was used to measure the impact of
the whole patchset:

  $ cat test-dbench.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/nvme0n1
  MNT=/mnt/btrfs
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o ssd"

  echo "performance" | \
      tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

  mkfs.btrfs -f -m single -d single $DEV
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

  dbench -D $MNT -t 300 64

  umount $MNT

The test was run on a machine with 12 cores, 64G of ram, using a NVMe
device and a non-debug kernel configuration (Debian's default).
