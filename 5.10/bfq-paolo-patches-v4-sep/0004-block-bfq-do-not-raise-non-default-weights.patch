Subject: [PATCH 04/19] block, bfq: do not raise non-default weights

BFQ heuristics try to detect interactive I/O, and raise the weight of
the queues containing such an I/O. Yet, if also the user changes the
weight of a queue (i.e., the user changes the ioprio of the process
associated with that queue), then it is most likely better to prevent
BFQ heuristics from silently changing the same weight.
