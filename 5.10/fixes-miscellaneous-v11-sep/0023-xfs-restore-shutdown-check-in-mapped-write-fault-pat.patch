Subject: [PATCH 23/23] xfs: restore shutdown check in mapped write fault path

XFS triggers an iomap warning in the write fault path due to a
!PageUptodate() page if a write fault happens to occur on a page
that recently failed writeback. The iomap writeback error handling
code can clear the Uptodate flag if no portion of the page is
submitted for I/O. This is reproduced by fstest generic/019, which
combines various forms of I/O with simulated disk failures that
inevitably lead to filesystem shutdown (which then unconditionally
fails page writeback).

This is a regression introduced by commit f150b4234397 ("xfs: split
the iomap ops for buffered vs direct writes") due to the removal of
a shutdown check and explicit error return in the ->iomap_begin()
path used by the write fault path. The explicit error return
historically translated to a SIGBUS, but now carries on with iomap
processing where it complains about the unexpected state. Restore
the shutdown check to xfs_buffered_write_iomap_begin() to restore
historical behavior.

Fixes: f150b4234397 ("xfs: split the iomap ops for buffered vs direct writes")
