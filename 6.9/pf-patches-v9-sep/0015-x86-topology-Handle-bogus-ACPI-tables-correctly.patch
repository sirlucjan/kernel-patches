Subject: [PATCH 15/19] x86/topology: Handle bogus ACPI tables correctly

The ACPI specification clearly states how the processors should be
enumerated in the MADT:

 "To ensure that the boot processor is supported post initialization,
  two guidelines should be followed. The first is that OSPM should
  initialize processors in the order that they appear in the MADT. The
  second is that platform firmware should list the boot processor as the
  first processor entry in the MADT.
  ...
  Failure of OSPM implementations and platform firmware to abide by
  these guidelines can result in both unpredictable and non optimal
  platform operation."

The kernel relies on that ordering to detect the real BSP on crash kernels
which is important to avoid sending a INIT IPI to it as that would cause a
full machine reset.

On a Dell XPS 16 9640 the BIOS ignores this rule and enumerates the CPUs in
the wrong order. As a consequence the kernel falsely detects a crash kernel
and disables the corresponding CPU.

Prevent this by checking the IA32_APICBASE MSR for the BSP bit on the boot
CPU. If that bit is set, then the MADT based BSP detection can be safely
ignored. If the kernel detects a mismatch between the BSP bit and the first
enumerated MADT entry then emit a firmware bug message.

This obviously also has to be taken into account when the boot APIC ID and
the first enumerated APIC ID match. If the boot CPU does not have the BSP
bit set in the APICBASE MSR then there is no way for the boot CPU to
determine which of the CPUs is the real BSP. Sending an INIT to the real
BSP would reset the machine so the only sane way to deal with that is to
limit the number of CPUs to one and emit a corresponding warning message.
