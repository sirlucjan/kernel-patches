Subject: [PATCH 25/25] crypto: x86/aes-gcm - rewrite the AES-NI optimized
 AES-GCM

Rewrite the AES-NI implementations of AES-GCM, taking advantage of
things I learned while writing the VAES-AVX10 implementations.  This is
a complete rewrite that reduces the AES-NI GCM source code size by about
70% and the binary code size by about 95%, while not regressing
performance and in fact improving it significantly in many cases.

The following summarizes the state before this patch:

- The aesni-intel module registered algorithms "generic-gcm-aesni" and
  "rfc4106-gcm-aesni" with the crypto API that actually delegated to one
  of three underlying implementations according to the CPU capabilities
  detected at runtime: AES-NI, AES-NI + AVX, or AES-NI + AVX2.

- The AES-NI + AVX and AES-NI + AVX2 assembly code was in
  aesni-intel_avx-x86_64.S and consisted of 2804 lines of source and
  257 KB of binary.  This massive binary size was not really
  appropriate, and depending on the kconfig it could take up over 1% the
  size of the entire vmlinux.  The main loops did 8 blocks per
  iteration.  The AVX code minimized the use of carryless multiplication
  whereas the AVX2 code did not.  The "AVX2" code did not actually use
  AVX2; the check for AVX2 was really a check for Intel Haswell or later
  to detect support for fast carryless multiplication.  The long source
  length was caused by factors such as significant code duplication.

- The AES-NI only assembly code was in aesni-intel_asm.S and consisted
  of 1501 lines of source and 15 KB of binary.  The main loops did 4
  blocks per iteration and minimized the use of carryless multiplication
  by using Karatsuba multiplication and a multiplication-less reduction.

- The assembly code was contributed in 2010-2013.  Maintenance has been
  sporadic and most design choices haven't been revisited.

- The assembly function prototypes and the corresponding glue code were
  separate from and were not consistent with the new VAES-AVX10 code I
  recently added.  The older code had several issues such as not
  precomputing the GHASH key powers, which hurt performance.

This rewrite achieves the following goals:

- Much shorter source and binary sizes.  The assembly source shrinks
  from 4300 lines to 1130 lines, and it produces about 9 KB of binary
  instead of 272 KB.  This is achieved via a better designed AES-GCM
  implementation that doesn't excessively unroll the code and instead
  prioritizes the parts that really matter.  Sharing the C glue code
  with the VAES-AVX10 implementations also saves 250 lines of C source.

- Improve performance on most (possibly all) CPUs on which this code
  runs, for most (possibly all) message lengths.  Benchmark results are
  given in Tables 1 and 2 below.

- Use the same function prototypes and glue code as the new VAES-AVX10
  algorithms.  This fixes some issues with the integration of the
  assembly and results in some significant performance improvements,
  primarily on short messages.  Also, the AVX and non-AVX
  implementations are now registered as separate algorithms with the
  crypto API, which makes them both testable by the self-tests.

- Keep support for AES-NI without AVX (for Westmere, Silvermont,
  Goldmont, and Tremont), but unify the source code with AES-NI + AVX.
  Since 256-bit vectors cannot be used without VAES anyway, this is made
  feasible by just using the non-VEX coded form of most instructions.

- Use a unified approach where the main loop does 8 blocks per iteration
  and uses Karatsuba multiplication to save one pclmulqdq per block but
  does not use the multiplication-less reduction.  This strikes a good
  balance across the range of CPUs on which this code runs.

- Don't spam the kernel log with an informational message on every boot.

AMD Zen 3          |   27% |   23% |   24% |   32% |   26% |

The above numbers are percentage improvements in single-thread
throughput, so e.g. an increase from 3000 MB/s to 3300 MB/s would be
listed as 10%.  They were collected by directly measuring the Linux
crypto API performance using a custom kernel module.  Note that indirect
benchmarks (e.g. 'cryptsetup benchmark' or benchmarking dm-crypt I/O)
include more overhead and won't see quite as much of a difference.  All
these benchmarks used an associated data length of 16 bytes.  Note that
AES-GCM is almost always used with short associated data lengths.

I didn't test Intel CPUs before Broadwell, AMD CPUs before Zen 1, or
Intel low-power CPUs, as these weren't readily available to me.
However, based on the design of the new code and the available
information about these other CPU microarchitectures, I wouldn't expect
any significant regressions, and there's a good chance performance is
improved just as it is above.

+//
+// This file implements AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) for x86_64 CPUs that
+// support the original set of AES instructions, i.e. AES-NI.  Two
+// implementations are provided, one that uses AVX and one that doesn't.  They
+// are very similar, being generated by the same macros.  The only difference is
+// that the AVX implementation takes advantage of VEX-coded instructions in some
+// places to avoid some 'movdqu' and 'movdqa' instructions.  The AVX
+// implementation does *not* use 256-bit vectors, as AES is not supported on
+// 256-bit vectors until the VAES feature (which this file doesn't target).
+//
+// The specific CPU feature prerequisites are AES-NI and PCLMULQDQ, plus SSE4.1
+// for the *_aesni functions or AVX for the *_aesni_avx ones.  (But it seems
+// there are no CPUs that support AES-NI without also PCLMULQDQ and SSE4.1.)
+//
+// The design generally follows that of aes-gcm-avx10-x86_64.S, and that file is
+// more thoroughly commented.  This file has the following notable changes:
+//
+//    - The vector length is fixed at 128-bit, i.e. xmm registers.  This means
+//      there is only one AES block (and GHASH block) per register.
+//
+//    - Without AVX512 / AVX10, only 16 SIMD registers are available instead of
+//      32.  We work around this by being much more careful about using
+//      registers, relying heavily on loads to load values as they are needed.
+//
+//    - Masking is not available either.  We work around this by implementing
+//      partial block loads and stores using overlapping scalar loads and stores
+//      combined with shifts and SSE4.1 insertion and extraction instructions.
+//
+//    - The main loop is organized differently due to the different design
+//      constraints.  First, with just one AES block per SIMD register, on some
+//      CPUs 4 registers don't saturate the 'aesenc' throughput.  We therefore
+//      do an 8-register wide loop.  Considering that and the fact that we have
+//      just 16 SIMD registers to work with, it's not feasible to cache AES
+//      round keys and GHASH key powers in registers across loop iterations.
+//      That's not ideal, but also not actually that bad, since loads can run in
+//      parallel with other instructions.  Significantly, this also makes it
+//      possible to roll up the inner loops, relying on hardware loop unrolling
+//      instead of software loop unrolling, greatly reducing code size.
+//
+//    - We implement the GHASH multiplications in the main loop using Karatsuba
+//      multiplication instead of schoolbook multiplication.  This saves one
+//      pclmulqdq instruction per block, at the cost of one 64-bit load, one
+//      pshufd, and 0.25 pxors per block.  (This is without the three-argument
+//      XOR support that would be provided by AVX512 / AVX10, which would be
+//      more beneficial to schoolbook than Karatsuba.)
+//
+//      As a rough approximation, we can assume that Karatsuba multiplication is
+//      faster than schoolbook multiplication in this context if one pshufd and
+//      0.25 pxors are cheaper than a pclmulqdq.  (We assume that the 64-bit
+//      load is "free" due to running in parallel with arithmetic instructions.)
+//      This is true on AMD CPUs, including all that support pclmulqdq up to at
+//      least Zen 3.  It's also true on older Intel CPUs: Westmere through
+//      Haswell on the Core side, and Silvermont through Goldmont Plus on the
+//      low-power side.  On some of these CPUs, pclmulqdq is quite slow, and the
+//      benefit of Karatsuba should be substantial.  On newer Intel CPUs,
+//      schoolbook multiplication should be faster, but only marginally.
+//
+//      Not all these CPUs were available to be tested.  However, benchmarks on
+//      available CPUs suggest that this approximation is plausible.  Switching
+//      to Karatsuba showed negligible change (< 1%) on Intel Broadwell,
+//      Skylake, and Cascade Lake, but it improved AMD Zen 1-3 by 6-7%.
+//      Considering that and the fact that Karatsuba should be even more
+//      beneficial on older Intel CPUs, it seems like the right choice here.
+//
+//      An additional 0.25 pclmulqdq per block (2 per 8 blocks) could be
+//      saved by using a multiplication-less reduction method.  We don't do that
+//      because it would require a large number of shift and xor instructions,
+//      making it less worthwhile and likely harmful on newer CPUs.
+//
+//      It does make sense to sometimes use a different reduction optimization
+//      that saves a pclmulqdq, though: precompute the hash key times x^64, and
+//      multiply the low half of the data block by the hash key with the extra
+//      factor of x^64.  This eliminates one step of the reduction.  However,
+//      this is incompatible with Karatsuba multiplication.  Therefore, for
+//      multi-block processing we use Karatsuba multiplication with a regular
+//      reduction.  For single-block processing, we use the x^64 optimization.
