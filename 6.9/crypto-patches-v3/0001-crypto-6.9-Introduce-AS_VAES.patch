+// This file implements AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) for x86_64 CPUs that
+// support VAES (vector AES), VPCLMULQDQ (vector carryless multiplication), and
+// either AVX512 or AVX10.  Some of the functions, notably the encryption and
+// decryption update functions which are the most performance-critical, are
+// provided in two variants generated from a macro: one using 256-bit vectors
+// (suffix: vaes_avx10_256) and one using 512-bit vectors (vaes_avx10_512).  The
+// other, "shared" functions (vaes_avx10) use at most 256-bit vectors.
+//
+// The functions that use 512-bit vectors are intended for CPUs that support
+// 512-bit vectors *and* where using them doesn't cause significant
+// downclocking.  They require the following CPU features:
+//
+//	VAES && VPCLMULQDQ && BMI2 && ((AVX512BW && AVX512VL) || AVX10/512)
+//
+// The other functions require the following CPU features:
+//
+//	VAES && VPCLMULQDQ && BMI2 && ((AVX512BW && AVX512VL) || AVX10/256)
+//
+// All functions use the "System V" ABI.  The Windows ABI is not supported.
+//
+// Note that we use "avx10" in the names of the functions as a shorthand to
+// really mean "AVX10 or a certain set of AVX512 features".  Due to Intel's
+// introduction of AVX512 and then its replacement by AVX10, there doesn't seem
+// to be a simple way to name things that makes sense on all CPUs.
+//
+// Note that the macros that support both 256-bit and 512-bit vectors could
+// fairly easily be changed to support 128-bit too.  However, this would *not*
+// be sufficient to allow the code to run on CPUs without AVX512 or AVX10,
+// because the code heavily uses several features of these extensions other than
+// the vector length: the increase in the number of SIMD registers from 16 to
+// 32, masking support, and new instructions such as vpternlogd (which can do a
+// three-argument XOR).  These features are very useful for AES-GCM.

+// The _ghash_mul_step macro does one step of GHASH multiplication of the
+// 128-bit lanes of \a by the corresponding 128-bit lanes of \b and storing the
+// reduced products in \dst.  \t0, \t1, and \t2 are temporary registers of the
+// same size as \a and \b.  To complete all steps, this must invoked with \i=0
+// through \i=9.  The division into steps allows users of this macro to
+// optionally interleave the computation with other instructions.  Users of this
+// macro must preserve the parameter registers across steps.
+//
+// The multiplications are done in GHASH's representation of the finite field
+// GF(2^128).  Elements of GF(2^128) are represented as binary polynomials
+// (i.e. polynomials whose coefficients are bits) modulo a reducing polynomial
+// G.  The GCM specification uses G = x^128 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1.  Addition is
+// just XOR, while multiplication is more complex and has two parts: (a) do
+// carryless multiplication of two 128-bit input polynomials to get a 256-bit
+// intermediate product polynomial, and (b) reduce the intermediate product to
+// 128 bits by adding multiples of G that cancel out terms in it.  (Adding
+// multiples of G doesn't change which field element the polynomial represents.)
+//
+// Unfortunately, the GCM specification maps bits to/from polynomial
+// coefficients backwards from the natural order.  In each byte it specifies the
+// highest bit to be the lowest order polynomial coefficient, *not* the highest!
+// This makes it nontrivial to work with the GHASH polynomials.  We could
+// reflect the bits, but x86 doesn't have an instruction that does that.
+//
+// Instead, we operate on the values without bit-reflecting them.  This *mostly*
+// just works, since XOR and carryless multiplication are symmetric with respect
+// to bit order, but it has some consequences.  First, due to GHASH's byte
+// order, by skipping bit reflection, *byte* reflection becomes necessary to
+// give the polynomial terms a consistent order.  E.g., considering an N-bit
+// value interpreted using the G = x^128 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1 convention, bits 0
+// through N-1 of the byte-reflected value represent the coefficients of x^(N-1)
+// through x^0, whereas bits 0 through N-1 of the non-byte-reflected value
+// represent x^7...x^0, x^15...x^8, ..., x^(N-1)...x^(N-8) which can't be worked
+// with.  Fortunately, x86's vpshufb instruction can do byte reflection.
+//
+// Second, forgoing the bit reflection causes an extra multiple of x (still
+// using the G = x^128 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1 convention) to be introduced by each
+// multiplication.  This is because an M-bit by N-bit carryless multiplication
+// really produces a (M+N-1)-bit product, but in practice it's zero-extended to
+// M+N bits.  In the G = x^128 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1 convention, which maps bits
+// to polynomial coefficients backwards, this zero-extension actually changes
+// the product by introducing an extra factor of x.  Therefore, users of this
+// macro must ensure that one of the inputs has an extra factor of x^-1, i.e.
+// the multiplicative inverse of x, to cancel out the extra x.
+//
+// Third, the backwards coefficients convention is just confusing to work with,
+// since it makes "low" and "high" in the polynomial math mean the opposite of
+// their normal meaning in computer programming.  This can be solved by using an
+// alternative interpretation: the polynomial coefficients are understood to be
+// in the natural order, and the multiplication is actually \a * \b * x^-128 mod
+// x^128 + x^127 + x^126 + x^121 + 1.  This doesn't change the inputs, outputs,
+// or the implementation at all; it just changes the mathematical interpretation
+// of what each instruction is doing.  Starting from here, we'll use this
+// alternative interpretation, as it's easier to understand the code that way.
+//
+// Moving onto the implementation, the vpclmulqdq instruction does 64 x 64 =>
+// 128-bit carryless multiplication, so we break the 128 x 128 multiplication
+// into parts as follows (the _L and _H suffixes denote low and high 64 bits):
+//
+//     LO = a_L * b_L
+//     MI = (a_L * b_H) + (a_H * b_L)
+//     HI = a_H * b_H
+//
+// The 256-bit product is x^128*HI + x^64*MI + LO.  LO, MI, and HI are 128-bit.
+// Note that MI "overlaps" with LO and HI.  We don't consolidate MI into LO and
+// HI right away, since the way the reduction works makes that unnecessary.
+//
+// For the reduction, we cancel out the low 128 bits by adding multiples of G =
+// x^128 + x^127 + x^126 + x^121 + 1.  This is done by two iterations, each of
+// which cancels out the next lowest 64 bits.  Consider a value x^64*A + B,
+// where A and B are 128-bit.  Adding B_L*G to that value gives:
+//
+//       x^64*A + B + B_L*G
+//     = x^64*A + x^64*B_H + B_L + B_L*(x^128 + x^127 + x^126 + x^121 + 1)
+//     = x^64*A + x^64*B_H + B_L + x^128*B_L + x^64*B_L*(x^63 + x^62 + x^57) + B_L
+//     = x^64*A + x^64*B_H + x^128*B_L + x^64*B_L*(x^63 + x^62 + x^57) + B_L + B_L
+//     = x^64*(A + B_H + x^64*B_L + B_L*(x^63 + x^62 + x^57))
+//
+// So: if we sum A, B with its halves swapped, and the low half of B times x^63
+// + x^62 + x^57, we get a 128-bit value C where x^64*C is congruent to the
+// original value x^64*A + B.  I.e., the low 64 bits got canceled out.
+//
+// We just need to apply this twice: first to fold LO into MI, and second to
+// fold the updated MI into HI.
+//
+// The needed three-argument XORs are done using the vpternlogd instruction with
+// immediate 0x96, since this is faster than two vpxord instructions.
+//
+// A potential optimization, assuming that b is fixed per-key (if a is fixed
+// per-key it would work the other way around), is to use one iteration of the
+// reduction described above to precompute a value c such that x^64*c = b mod G,
+// and then multiply a_L by c (and implicitly by x^64) instead of by b:
+//
+//     MI = (a_L * c_L) + (a_H * b_L)
+//     HI = (a_L * c_H) + (a_H * b_H)
+//
+// This would eliminate the LO part of the intermediate product, which would
+// eliminate the need to fold LO into MI.  This would save two instructions,
+// including a vpclmulqdq.  However, we currently don't use this optimization
+// because it would require twice as many per-key precomputed values.
+//
+// Using Karatsuba multiplication instead of "schoolbook" multiplication

+/*
+ * This file implements AES-XTS for modern x86_64 CPUs.  To handle the
+ * complexities of coding for x86 SIMD, e.g. where every vector length needs
+ * different code, it uses a macro to generate several implementations that
+ * share similar source code but are targeted at different CPUs, listed below:
+ *
+ * AES-NI + AVX
+ *    - 128-bit vectors (1 AES block per vector)
+ *    - VEX-coded instructions
+ *    - xmm0-xmm15
+ *    - This is for older CPUs that lack VAES but do have AVX.
+ *
+ * VAES + VPCLMULQDQ + AVX2
+ *    - 256-bit vectors (2 AES blocks per vector)
+ *    - VEX-coded instructions
+ *    - ymm0-ymm15
+ *    - This is for CPUs that have VAES but lack AVX512 or AVX10,
+ *      e.g. Intel's Alder Lake and AMD's Zen 3.
+ *
+ * VAES + VPCLMULQDQ + AVX10/256 + BMI2
+ *    - 256-bit vectors (2 AES blocks per vector)
+ *    - EVEX-coded instructions
+ *    - ymm0-ymm31
+ *    - This is for CPUs that have AVX512 but where using zmm registers causes
+ *      downclocking, and for CPUs that have AVX10/256 but not AVX10/512.
+ *    - By "AVX10/256" we really mean (AVX512BW + AVX512VL) || AVX10/256.
+ *      To avoid confusion with 512-bit, we just write AVX10/256.
+ *
+ * VAES + VPCLMULQDQ + AVX10/512 + BMI2
+ *    - Same as the previous one, but upgrades to 512-bit vectors
+ *      (4 AES blocks per vector) in zmm0-zmm31.
+ *    - This is for CPUs that have good AVX512 or AVX10/512 support.
+ *
+ * This file doesn't have an implementation for AES-NI alone (without AVX), as
+ * the lack of VEX would make all the assembly code different.
+ *
+ * When we use VAES, we also use VPCLMULQDQ to parallelize the computation of
+ * the XTS tweaks.  This avoids a bottleneck.  Currently there don't seem to be
