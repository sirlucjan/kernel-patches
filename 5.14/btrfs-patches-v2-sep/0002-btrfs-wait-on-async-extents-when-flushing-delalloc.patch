Subject: [PATCH 02/28] btrfs: wait on async extents when flushing delalloc

I've been debugging an early ENOSPC problem in production and finally
root caused it to this problem.  When we switched to the per-inode in
38d715f494f2 ("btrfs: use btrfs_start_delalloc_roots in
shrink_delalloc") I pulled out the async extent handling, because we
were doing the correct thing by calling filemap_flush() if we had async
extents set.  This would properly wait on any async extents by locking
the page in the second flush, thus making sure our ordered extents were
properly set up.

However when I switched us back to page based flushing, I used
sync_inode(), which allows us to pass in our own wbc.  The problem here
is that sync_inode() is smarter than the filemap_* helpers, it tries to
avoid calling writepages at all.  This means that our second call could
skip calling do_writepages altogether, and thus not wait on the pagelock
for the async helpers.  This means we could come back before any ordered
extents were created and then simply continue on in our flushing
mechanisms and ENOSPC out when we have plenty of space to use.

Fix this by putting back the async pages logic in shrink_delalloc.  This
allows us to bulk write out everything that we need to, and then we can
wait in one place for the async helpers to catch up, and then wait on
any ordered extents that are created.
