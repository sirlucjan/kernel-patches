Subject: [PATCH 24/39] block, bfq: Accept symmetric weight adjustments
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The allowed range for BFQ weights is currently 1..1000 with 100 being
the default. There is no apparent reason to not accept weight
adjustments of same ratio on both sides of the default. This change
makes the attribute domain consistent with other cgroup (v2) knobs with
the weight semantics.

This extension of the range does not restrict existing configurations
(quite the opposite). This may affect setups where weights >1000 were
attempted to be set but failed with the default 100. Such cgroups would
attain their intended weight now. This is a changed behavior but it
rectifies the situation (similar intention to the commit 69d7fde5909b
("blkcg: use CGROUP_WEIGHT_* scale for io.weight on the unified
hierarchy") for CFQ formerly (and v2 only)).

Additionally, the changed range does not imply all IO workloads can be
really controlled to achieve the widest possible ratio 1:10^4.
