Subject: [PATCH 19/83] fs/ntfs3: Restyle comment block in ni_parse_reparse()

First of this fix one none utf8 char in this comment block. Maybe
this happened because error in filesystem ;)

Also this block was hard to read because long lines so make it max 80
long. And while we doing this stuff make little better grammer.
