Subject: [PATCH 01/24] btrfs: add a force_chunk_alloc to space_info's sysfs

In testing various things such as the btrfsck patch to detect over
allocation of chunks, empty block group deletion, and balance I've had
various ways to force chunk allocations for debug purposes.  Add a sysfs
file to enable forcing of chunk allocation for the owning space info in
order to enable us to add testcases in the future to test these various
features easier.

Subject: [PATCH 02/24] btrfs: enable a tracepoint when we fail tickets

When debugging early enospc problems it was useful to have a tracepoint
where we failed all tickets so I could check the state of the enospc
counters at failure time to validate my fixes.  This adds the tracpoint
so you can easily get that information.

Subject: [PATCH 03/24] btrfs: include delalloc related info in dump space info
 tracepoint

In order to debug delalloc flushing issues I added delalloc_bytes and
ordered_bytes to this tracepoint to see if they were non-zero when we
were going ENOSPC. This was valuable for me and showed me cases where we
weren't waiting on ordered extents properly. In order to add this to the
tracepoint we need to take away the const modifier for fs_info, as
percpu_sum_counter_positive() will change the counter when it adds up
the percpu buckets.  This is needed to make sure we're getting accurate
information at these tracepoints, as the wrong information could send us
down the wrong path when debugging problems.

Subject: [PATCH 04/24] btrfs: avoid unnecessary lock and leaf splits when
 updating inode in the log

During a fast fsync, if we have already fsynced the file before and in the
current transaction, we can make the inode item update more efficient and
avoid acquiring a write lock on the leaf's parent.

To update the inode item we are always using btrfs_insert_empty_item() to
get a path pointing to the inode item, which calls btrfs_search_slot()
with an "ins_len" argument of 'sizeof(struct btrfs_inode_item) +
sizeof(struct btrfs_item)', and that always results in the search taking
a write lock on the level 1 node that is the parent of the leaf that
contains the inode item. This adds unnecessary lock contention on log
trees when we have multiple fsyncs in parallel against inodes in the same
subvolume, which has a very significant impact due to the fact that log
trees are short lived and their height very rarely goes beyond level 2.

Also, by using btrfs_insert_empty_item() when we need to update the inode
item, we also end up splitting the leaf of the existing inode item when
the leaf has an amount of free space smaller than the size of an inode
item.

Improve this by using btrfs_seach_slot(), with a 0 "ins_len" argument,
when we know the inode item already exists in the log. This avoids these
two inefficiencies.

The following script, using fio, was used to perform the tests:

  $ cat fio-test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/nvme0n1
  MNT=/mnt/nvme0n1
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o ssd"
  MKFS_OPTIONS="-d single -m single"

  if [ $# -ne 4 ]; then
    echo "Use $0 NUM_JOBS FILE_SIZE FSYNC_FREQ BLOCK_SIZE"
    exit 1
  fi

  NUM_JOBS=$1
  FILE_SIZE=$2
  FSYNC_FREQ=$3
  BLOCK_SIZE=$4

  cat <<EOF > /tmp/fio-job.ini
  [writers]
  rw=randwrite
  fsync=$FSYNC_FREQ
  fallocate=none
  group_reporting=1
  direct=0
  bs=$BLOCK_SIZE
  ioengine=sync
  size=$FILE_SIZE
  directory=$MNT
  numjobs=$NUM_JOBS
  EOF

  echo "performance" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

  echo
  echo "Using config:"
  echo
  cat /tmp/fio-job.ini
  echo
  echo "mount options: $MOUNT_OPTIONS"
  echo

  umount $MNT &> /dev/null
  mkfs.btrfs -f $MKFS_OPTIONS $DEV
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

  fio /tmp/fio-job.ini
  umount $MNT

The tests were done on a physical machine, with 12 cores, 64G of RAM,
using a NVMEe device and using a non-debug kernel config (the default one
from Debian). The summary line from fio is provided below for each test
run.

With 8 jobs, file size 256M, fsync frequency of 4 and a block size of 4K:

Before: WRITE: bw=28.3MiB/s (29.7MB/s), 28.3MiB/s-28.3MiB/s (29.7MB/s-29.7MB/s), io=2048MiB (2147MB), run=72297-72297msec
After:  WRITE: bw=28.7MiB/s (30.1MB/s), 28.7MiB/s-28.7MiB/s (30.1MB/s-30.1MB/s), io=2048MiB (2147MB), run=71411-71411msec

+1.4% throughput, -1.2% runtime

With 16 jobs, file size 256M, fsync frequency of 4 and a block size of 4K:

Before: WRITE: bw=40.0MiB/s (42.0MB/s), 40.0MiB/s-40.0MiB/s (42.0MB/s-42.0MB/s), io=4096MiB (4295MB), run=99980-99980msec
After:  WRITE: bw=40.9MiB/s (42.9MB/s), 40.9MiB/s-40.9MiB/s (42.9MB/s-42.9MB/s), io=4096MiB (4295MB), run=97933-97933msec

+2.2% throughput, -2.1% runtime

The changes are small but it's possible to be better on faster hardware as
in the test machine used disk utilization was pretty much 100% during the
whole time the tests were running (observed with 'iostat -xz 1').

The tests also included the previous patch with the subject of:
"btrfs: avoid unnecessary log mutex contention when syncing log".
So they compared a branch without that patch and without this patch versus
a branch with these two patches applied.

Subject: [PATCH 05/24] btrfs: avoid unnecessary log mutex contention when
 syncing log

When syncing the log we acquire the root's log mutex just to update the
root's last_log_commit. This is unnecessary because:

1) At this point there can only be one task updating this value, which is
   the task committing the current log transaction. Any task that enters
   btrfs_sync_log() has to wait for the previous log transaction to commit
   and wait for the current log transaction to commit if someone else
   already started it (in this case it never reaches to the point of
   updating last_log_commit, as that is done by the committing task);

2) All readers of the root's last_log_commit don't acquire the root's
   log mutex. This is to avoid blocking the readers, potentially for too
   long and because getting a stale value of last_log_commit does not
   cause any functional problem, in the worst case getting a stale value
   results in logging an inode unnecessarily. Plus it's actually very
   rare to get a stale value that results in unnecessarily logging the
   inode.

So in order to avoid unnecessary contention on the root's log mutex,
which is used for several different purposes, like starting/joining a
log transaction and starting writeback of a log transaction, stop
acquiring the log mutex for updating the root's last_log_commit.

Subject: [PATCH 06/24] btrfs: continue readahead of siblings even if target
 node is in memory

At reada_for_search(), when attempting to readahead a node or leaf's
siblings, we skip the readahead of the siblings if the node/leaf is
already in memory. That is probably fine for the READA_FORWARD and
READA_BACK readahead types, as they are used on contexts where we
end up reading some consecutive leaves, but usually not the whole btree.

However for a READA_FORWARD_ALWAYS mode, currently only used for full
send operations, it does not make sense to skip the readahead if the
target node or leaf is already loaded in memory, since we know the caller
is visiting every node and leaf of the btree in ascending order.

So change the behaviour to not skip the readahead when the target node is
already in memory and the readahead mode is READA_FORWARD_ALWAYS.

The following test script was used to measure the improvement on a box
using an average, consumer grade, spinning disk, with 32GiB of RAM and
using a non-debug kernel config (Debian's default config).

      echo "Creating $total new files using $number_jobs jobs"
      for ((n = 0; n < $number_jobs; n++)); do
          (
              local start_num=$(($start_offset + $n * $total_per_job))

                  local file_num=$((start_num + $i))
                  local file_path="$MNT/file_${file_num}"
                  xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xab 0 2000" $file_path > /dev/null

Subject: [PATCH 07/24] btrfs: improve the batch insertion of delayed items

When we insert the delayed items of an inode, which corresponds to the
directory index keys for a directory (key type BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY), we
do the following:

1) Pick the first delayed item from the rbtree and insert it into the
   fs/subvolume btree, using btrfs_insert_empty_item() for that;

2) Without releasing the path returned by btrfs_insert_empty_item(),
   keep collecting as many consecutive delayed items from the rbtree
   as possible, as long as each one's BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY key is the
   immediate successor of the previously picked item and as long as
   they fit in the available space of the leaf the path points to;

3) Then insert all the collected items into the leaf;

4) Release the reserve metadata space for each collected item and
   release each item (implies deleting from the rbtree);

5) Unlock the path.

While this is much better than inserting items one by one, it can be
improved in a few aspects:

1) Instead of adding items based on the remaining free space of the
   leaf, collect as many items that can fit in a leaf and bulk insert
   them. This results in less and larger batches, reducing the total
   amount of time to insert the delayed items. For example when adding
   100K files to a directory, we ended up creating 1658 batches with
   very variable sizes ranging from 1 item to 118 items, on a filesystem
   with a node/leaf size of 16K. After this change, we end up with 839
   batches, with the vast majority of them having exactly 120 items;

2) We do the search for more items to batch, by iterating the rbtree,
   while holding a write lock on the leaf;

3) While still holding the leaf locked, we are releasing the reserved
   metadata for each item and then deleting each item, keeping a write
   lock on the leaf for longer than necessary. Releasing the delayed items
   one by one can take a significant amount of time, because deleting
   them from the rbtree can often be a bit slow when the deletion results
   in rebalancing the rbtree.

So change this so that we try to create larger batches, with a total
item size up to the maximum a leaf can support, and by unlocking the leaf
immediately after inserting the items, releasing the reserved metadata
space of each item and releasing each item without holding the write lock
on the leaf.

The following script that runs fs_mark was used to test this change:

  $ cat test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/nvme0n1
  MNT=/mnt/nvme0n1
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o ssd"
  MKFS_OPTIONS="-m single -d single"
  FILES=1000000
  THREADS=16
  FILE_SIZE=0

  echo "performance" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

  umount $DEV &> /dev/null
  mkfs.btrfs -f $MKFS_OPTIONS $DEV
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

  OPTS="-S 0 -L 5 -n $FILES -s $FILE_SIZE -t 16"
  for ((i = 1; i <= $THREADS; i++)); do
      OPTS="$OPTS -d $MNT/d$i"
  done

  fs_mark $OPTS

  umount $MNT

It was run on machine with 12 cores, 64G of ram, using a NVMe device and
using a non-debug kernel config (Debian's default config).

Subject: [PATCH 08/24] btrfs: remove unnecessary list head initialization when
 syncing log

One of the last steps of syncing the log is to remove all log contexts
from the root's list of contexts, done at btrfs_remove_all_log_ctxs().
There we iterate over all the contexts in the list and delete each one
from the list, and after that we call INIT_LIST_HEAD() on the list. That
is unnecessary since at that point the list is empty.

So just remove the INIT_LIST_HEAD() call. It's not needed, increases code
size (bloat-o-meter reported a delta of -122 for btrfs_sync_log() after
this change) and increases two critical sections delimited by log mutexes.

Subject: [PATCH 09/24] btrfs: stop doing GFP_KERNEL memory allocations in the
 ref verify tool

In commit 351cbf6e4410e7 ("btrfs: use nofs allocations for running delayed
items") we wrapped all btree updates when running delayed items with
memalloc_nofs_save() and memalloc_nofs_restore(), due to a lock inversion
detected by lockdep involving reclaim and the mutex of delayed nodes.

The problem is because the ref verify tool does some memory allocations
with GFP_KERNEL, which can trigger reclaim and reclaim can trigger inode
eviction, which requires locking the mutex of an inode's delayed node.
On the other hand the ref verify tool is called when allocating metadata
extents as part of operations that modify a btree, which is a problem when
running delayed nodes, where we do btree updates while holding the mutex
of a delayed node. This is what caused the lockdep warning.

Instead of wrapping every btree update when running delayed nodes, change
the ref verify tool to never do GFP_KERNEL allocations, because:

1) We get less repeated code, which at the moment does not even have a
   comment mentioning why we need to setup the NOFS context, which is a
   recommended good practice as mentioned at
   Documentation/core-api/gfp_mask-from-fs-io.rst

2) The ref verify tool is something meant only for debugging and not
   something that should be enabled on non-debug / non-development
   kernels;

3) We may have yet more places outside delayed-inode.c where we have
   similar problem: doing btree updates while holding some lock and
   then having the GFP_KERNEL memory allocations, from the ref verify
   tool, trigger reclaim and trying again to acquire the same lock
   through the reclaim path.
   Or we could get more such cases in the future, therefore this change
   prevents getting into similar cases when using the ref verify tool.

Curiously most of the memory allocations done by the ref verify tool
were already using GFP_NOFS, except a few ones for no apparent reason.

Subject: [PATCH 10/24] btrfs: make btrfs_next_leaf static inline

btrfs_next_leaf is a simple wrapper for btrfs_next_old_leaf so move it
to header to avoid the function call overhead.

Subject: [PATCH 15/24] btrfs: do not pin logs too early during renames

During renames we pin the logs of the roots a bit too early, before the
calls to btrfs_insert_inode_ref(). We can pin the logs after those calls,
since those will not change anything in a log tree.

In a scenario where we have multiple and diverse filesystem operations
running in parallel, those calls can take a significant amount of time,
due to lock contention on extent buffers, and delay log commits from other
tasks for longer than necessary.

So just pin logs after calls to btrfs_insert_inode_ref() and right before
the first operation that can update a log tree.

The following script that uses dbench was used for testing:

  $ cat dbench-test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/nvme0n1
  MNT=/mnt/nvme0n1
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o ssd"
  MKFS_OPTIONS="-m single -d single"

  echo "performance" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

  umount $DEV &> /dev/null
  mkfs.btrfs -f $MKFS_OPTIONS $DEV
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

  dbench -D $MNT -t 120 16

  umount $MNT

The tests were run on a machine with 12 cores, 64G of RAN, a NVMe device
and using a non-debug kernel config (Debian's default config).

The results compare a branch without this patch and without the previous
patch in the series, that has the subject:

 "btrfs: eliminate some false positives when checking if inode was logged"

Versus the same branch with these two patches applied.

dbench with 8 clients, results before:

Subject: [PATCH 16/24] btrfs: eliminate some false positives when checking if
 inode was logged

When checking if an inode was previously logged in the current transaction
through the helper inode_logged(), we can return some false positives that
can be easily eliminated. These correspond to the cases where an inode has
a ->logged_trans value that is not zero and its value is smaller then the
ID of the current transaction. This means we know exactly that the inode
was never logged before in the current transaction, so we can return false
and avoid the callers to do extra work:

1) Having btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log() and btrfs_del_inode_ref_in_log()
   unnecessarily join a log transaction and do deletion searches in a log
   tree that will not find anything. This just adds unnecessary contention
   on extent buffer locks;

2) Having btrfs_log_new_name() unnecessarily log an inode when it is not
   needed. If the inode was not logged before, we don't need to log it in
   LOG_INODE_EXISTS mode.

So just make sure that any false positive only happens when ->logged_trans
has a value of 0.

Subject: [PATCH 17/24] btrfs: avoid unnecessarily logging directories that had
 no changes

There are several cases where when logging an inode we need to log its
parent directories or logging subdirectories when logging a directory.

There are cases however where we end up logging a directory even if it was
not changed in the current transaction, no dentries added or removed since
the last transaction. While this is harmless from a functional point of
view, it is a waste time as it brings no advantage.

One example where this is triggered is the following:

  $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
  $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt

  $ mkdir /mnt/A
  $ mkdir /mnt/B
  $ mkdir /mnt/C

  $ touch /mnt/A/foo
  $ ln /mnt/A/foo /mnt/B/bar
  $ ln /mnt/A/foo /mnt/C/baz

  $ sync

  $ rm -f /mnt/A/foo
  $ xfs_io -c "fsync" /mnt/B/bar

This last fsync ends up logging directories A, B and C, however we only
need to log directory A, as B and C were not changed since the last
transaction commit.

So fix this by changing need_log_inode(), to return false in case the
given inode is a directory and has a ->last_trans value smaller than the
current transaction's ID.

Subject: [PATCH 18/24] btrfs: fix mount failure due to past and transient
 device flush error

When we get an error flushing one device, during a super block commit, we
record the error in the device structure, in the field 'last_flush_error'.
This is used to later check if we should error out the super block commit,
depending on whether the number of flush errors is greater than or equals
to the maximum tolerated device failures for a raid profile.

However if we get a transient device flush error, unmount the filesystem
and later try to mount it, we can fail the mount because we treat that
past error as critical and consider the device is missing. Even if it's
very likely that the error will happen again, as it's probably due to a
hardware related problem, there may be cases where the error might not
happen again. One example is during testing, and a test case like the
new generic/648 from fstests always triggers this. The test cases
generic/019 and generic/475 also trigger this scenario, but very
sporadically.

When this happens we get an error like this:

  $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt
  mount: /mnt wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdc, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.

  $ dmesg
  (...)
  [12918.886926] BTRFS warning (device sdc): chunk 13631488 missing 1 devices, max tolerance is 0 for writable mount
  [12918.888293] BTRFS warning (device sdc): writable mount is not allowed due to too many missing devices
  [12918.890853] BTRFS error (device sdc): open_ctree failed

So fix this by making sure btrfs_check_rw_degradable() does not consider
flush errors from past mounts when it's being called either on a mount
context or on a RO to RW remount context, and clears the flush errors
from the devices. Any path that triggers a super block commit during
mount/remount must still check for any flush errors and lead to a
mount/remount failure if any are found - all these paths (replaying log
trees, convert space cache v1 to v2, etc) all happen after the first
call to btrfs_check_rw_degradable(), which is the only call that should
ignore and reset past flush errors from the devices.

Subject: [PATCH 19/24] btrfs: remove the failing device argument from
 btrfs_check_rw_degradable()

Currently all callers of btrfs_check_rw_degradable() pass a NULL value for
its 'failing_dev' argument, therefore making it useless. So just remove
that argument.

Subject: [PATCH 22/24] btrfs: fix mount failure due to past and transient
 device flush error

When we get an error flushing one device, during a super block commit, we
record the error in the device structure, in the field 'last_flush_error'.
This is used to later check if we should error out the super block commit,
depending on whether the number of flush errors is greater than or equals
to the maximum tolerated device failures for a raid profile.

However if we get a transient device flush error, unmount the filesystem
and later try to mount it, we can fail the mount because we treat that
past error as critical and consider the device is missing. Even if it's
very likely that the error will happen again, as it's probably due to a
hardware related problem, there may be cases where the error might not
happen again. One example is during testing, and a test case like the
new generic/648 from fstests always triggers this. The test cases
generic/019 and generic/475 also trigger this scenario, but very
sporadically.

When this happens we get an error like this:

  $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt
  mount: /mnt wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdc, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.

  $ dmesg
  (...)
  [12918.886926] BTRFS warning (device sdc): chunk 13631488 missing 1 devices, max tolerance is 0 for writable mount
  [12918.888293] BTRFS warning (device sdc): writable mount is not allowed due to too many missing devices
  [12918.890853] BTRFS error (device sdc): open_ctree failed

The failure happens because when btrfs_check_rw_degradable() is called at
mount time, or at remount from RO to RW time, is sees a non zero value in
a device's ->last_flush_error attribute, and therefore considers that the
device is 'missing'.

Fix this by setting a device's ->last_flush_error to zero when we close a
device, making sure the error is not seen on the next mount attempt. We
only need to track flush errors during the current mount, so that we never
commit a super block if such errors happened.

Subject: [PATCH 23/24] btrfs: use the filemap_fdatawrite_wbc helper for
 delalloc shrinking

sync_inode() has some holes that can cause problems if we're under heavy
ENOSPC pressure.  If there's writeback running on a separate thread
sync_inode() will skip writing the inode altogether.  What we really
want is to make sure writeback has been started on all the pages to make
sure we can see the ordered extents and wait on them if appropriate.
Switch to this new helper which will allow us to accomplish this and
avoid ENOSPC'ing early.

  WARNING: lock held when returning to user space!
  5.15.0-rc1 #16 Not tainted
  ------------------------------------------------
  syz-executor/7579 is leaving the kernel with locks still held!
  1 lock held by syz-executor/7579:
   #0: ffff888104b73da8 (btrfs-tree-01/1){+.+.}-{3:3}, at:
  __btrfs_tree_lock+0x2e/0x1a0 fs/btrfs/locking.c:112

[CAUSE]
In btrfs_alloc_tree_block(), after btrfs_init_new_buffer(), the new
extent buffer @buf is locked, but if later operations like adding
delayed tree ref fails, we just free @buf without unlocking it,
resulting above warning.

[FIX]
Unlock @buf in out_free_buf: tag.
