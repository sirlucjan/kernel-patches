Subject: [PATCH 06/25] btrfs: use delalloc_bytes to determine flush amount for
 shrink_delalloc

We have been hitting some early ENOSPC issues in production with more
recent kernels, and I tracked it down to us simply not flushing delalloc
as aggressively as we should be.  With tracing I was seeing us failing
all tickets with all of the block rsvs at or around 0, with very little
pinned space, but still around 120MiB of outstanding bytes_may_used.
Upon further investigation I saw that we were flushing around 14 pages
per shrink call for delalloc, despite having around 2GiB of delalloc
outstanding.

Consider the example of a 8 way machine, all CPUs trying to create a
file in parallel, which at the time of this commit requires 5 items to
do.  Assuming a 16k leaf size, we have 10MiB of total metadata reclaim
size waiting on reservations.  Now assume we have 128MiB of delalloc
outstanding.  With our current math we would set items to 20, and then
set to_reclaim to 20 * 256k, or 5MiB.

Assuming that we went through this loop all 3 times, for both
FLUSH_DELALLOC and FLUSH_DELALLOC_WAIT, and then did the full loop
twice, we'd only flush 60MiB of the 128MiB delalloc space.  This could
leave a fair bit of delalloc reservations still hanging around by the
time we go to ENOSPC out all the remaining tickets.

Fix this two ways.  First, change the calculations to be a fraction of
the total delalloc bytes on the system.  Prior to this change we were
calculating based on dirty inodes so our math made more sense, now it's
just completely unrelated to what we're actually doing.

Second add a FLUSH_DELALLOC_FULL state, that we hold off until we've
gone through the flush states at least once.  This will empty the system
of all delalloc so we're sure to be truly out of space when we start
failing tickets.

I'm tagging stable 5.10 and forward, because this is where we started
using the page stuff heavily again.  This affects earlier kernel
versions as well, but would be a pain to backport to them as the
flushing mechanisms aren't the same.
