Subject: [PATCH 04/26] btrfs: avoid unnecessary lock and leaf splits when
 updating inode in the log

During a fast fsync, if we have already fsynced the file before and in the
current transaction, we can make the inode item update more efficient and
avoid acquiring a write lock on the leaf's parent.

To update the inode item we are always using btrfs_insert_empty_item() to
get a path pointing to the inode item, which calls btrfs_search_slot()
with an "ins_len" argument of 'sizeof(struct btrfs_inode_item) +
sizeof(struct btrfs_item)', and that always results in the search taking
a write lock on the level 1 node that is the parent of the leaf that
contains the inode item. This adds unnecessary lock contention on log
trees when we have multiple fsyncs in parallel against inodes in the same
subvolume, which has a very significant impact due to the fact that log
trees are short lived and their height very rarely goes beyond level 2.

Also, by using btrfs_insert_empty_item() when we need to update the inode
item, we also end up splitting the leaf of the existing inode item when
the leaf has an amount of free space smaller than the size of an inode
item.

Improve this by using btrfs_seach_slot(), with a 0 "ins_len" argument,
when we know the inode item already exists in the log. This avoids these
two inefficiencies.

The following script, using fio, was used to perform the tests:

  $ cat fio-test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/nvme0n1
  MNT=/mnt/nvme0n1
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o ssd"
  MKFS_OPTIONS="-d single -m single"

  if [ $# -ne 4 ]; then
    echo "Use $0 NUM_JOBS FILE_SIZE FSYNC_FREQ BLOCK_SIZE"
    exit 1
  fi

  NUM_JOBS=$1
  FILE_SIZE=$2
  FSYNC_FREQ=$3
  BLOCK_SIZE=$4

  cat <<EOF > /tmp/fio-job.ini
  [writers]
  rw=randwrite
  fsync=$FSYNC_FREQ
  fallocate=none
  group_reporting=1
  direct=0
  bs=$BLOCK_SIZE
  ioengine=sync
  size=$FILE_SIZE
  directory=$MNT
  numjobs=$NUM_JOBS
  EOF

  echo "performance" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

  echo
  echo "Using config:"
  echo
  cat /tmp/fio-job.ini
  echo
  echo "mount options: $MOUNT_OPTIONS"
  echo

  umount $MNT &> /dev/null
  mkfs.btrfs -f $MKFS_OPTIONS $DEV
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

  fio /tmp/fio-job.ini
  umount $MNT

The tests were done on a physical machine, with 12 cores, 64G of RAM,
using a NVMEe device and using a non-debug kernel config (the default one
from Debian). The summary line from fio is provided below for each test
run.

With 8 jobs, file size 256M, fsync frequency of 4 and a block size of 4K:

Before: WRITE: bw=28.3MiB/s (29.7MB/s), 28.3MiB/s-28.3MiB/s (29.7MB/s-29.7MB/s), io=2048MiB (2147MB), run=72297-72297msec
After:  WRITE: bw=28.7MiB/s (30.1MB/s), 28.7MiB/s-28.7MiB/s (30.1MB/s-30.1MB/s), io=2048MiB (2147MB), run=71411-71411msec

+1.4% throughput, -1.2% runtime

With 16 jobs, file size 256M, fsync frequency of 4 and a block size of 4K:

Before: WRITE: bw=40.0MiB/s (42.0MB/s), 40.0MiB/s-40.0MiB/s (42.0MB/s-42.0MB/s), io=4096MiB (4295MB), run=99980-99980msec
After:  WRITE: bw=40.9MiB/s (42.9MB/s), 40.9MiB/s-40.9MiB/s (42.9MB/s-42.9MB/s), io=4096MiB (4295MB), run=97933-97933msec

+2.2% throughput, -2.1% runtime

The changes are small but it's possible to be better on faster hardware as
in the test machine used disk utilization was pretty much 100% during the
whole time the tests were running (observed with 'iostat -xz 1').

The tests also included the previous patch with the subject of:
"btrfs: avoid unnecessary log mutex contention when syncing log".
So they compared a branch without that patch and without this patch versus
a branch with these two patches applied.
