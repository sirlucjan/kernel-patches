Subject: [PATCH 6/8] x86/ACPI/State: Optimize C3 entry on AMD CPUs

AMD CPU which support C3 shares cache. Its not necessary to flush the
caches in software before entering C3. This will cause performance drop
for the cores which share some caches. ARB_DIS is not used with current
AMD C state implementation. So set related flags correctly.
