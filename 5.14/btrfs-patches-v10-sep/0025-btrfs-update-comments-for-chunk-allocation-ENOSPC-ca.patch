Subject: [PATCH 25/25] btrfs: update comments for chunk allocation -ENOSPC
 cases

Update the comments at btrfs_chunk_alloc() and do_chunk_alloc() that
describe which cases can lead to a failure to allocate metadata and system
space despite having previously reserved space. This adds one more reason
that I previously forgot to mention.
