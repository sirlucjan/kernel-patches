Subject: [PATCH 70/72] block, bfq: reset last_bfqq_created on group change

Since commit 430a67f9d616 ("block, bfq: merge bursts of newly-created
queues"), BFQ maintains a per-group pointer to the last bfq_queue
created. If such a queue, say bfqq, happens to move to a different
group, then bfqq is no more a valid last bfq_queue created for its
previous group. That pointer must then be cleared. Not resetting such
a pointer may also cause UAF, if bfqq happens to also be freed after
being moved to a different group. This commit performs this missing
reset. As such it fixes commit 430a67f9d616 ("block, bfq: merge bursts
of newly-created queues").

Such a missing reset is most likely the cause of the crash reported in [1].
With some analysis, we found that this crash was due to the
above UAF. And such UAF did go away with this commit applied [1].

Anyway, before this commit, that crash happened to be triggered in
conjunction with commit 2d52c58b9c9b ("block, bfq: honor already-setup
queue merges"). The latter was then reverted by commit ebc69e897e17
("Revert "block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges""). Yet commit
2d52c58b9c9b ("block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges") contains
no error related with the above UAF, and can then be restored.
