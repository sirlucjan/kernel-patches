Subject: [PATCH 77/92] slab: Explain why SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU reference before
 locking

It is not obvious to the casual user why it is absolutely necessary to
acquire a reference to a SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU structure before acquiring
a lock in that structure.  Therefore, add a comment explaining this point.

[ paulmck: Apply Vlastimil Babka feedback. ]
