Subject: [PATCH 22/92] tools/memory-model: Weaken ctrl dependency definition
 in explanation.txt
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The current informal control dependency definition in explanation.txt is
too broad and, as discussed, needs to be updated.

Consider the following example:

> if(READ_ONCE(x))
>   return 42;
>
> WRITE_ONCE(y, 42);
>
> return 21;

The read event determines whether the write event will be executed "at all"
- as per the current definition - but the formal LKMM does not recognize
this as a control dependency.

Introduce a new definition which includes the requirement for the second
memory access event to syntactically lie within the arm of a non-loop
conditional.
