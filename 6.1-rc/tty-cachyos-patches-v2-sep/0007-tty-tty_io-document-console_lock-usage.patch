Subject: [PATCH 07/40] tty: tty_io: document console_lock usage

show_cons_active() uses the console_lock to gather information
on registered consoles. Since the console_lock is being used for
multiple reasons, explicitly document these reasons. This will
be useful when the console_lock is split into fine-grained
locking.
