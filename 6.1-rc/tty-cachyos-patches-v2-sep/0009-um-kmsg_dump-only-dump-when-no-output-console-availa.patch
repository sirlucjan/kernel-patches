Subject: [PATCH 09/40] um: kmsg_dump: only dump when no output console
 available

The initial intention of the UML kmsg_dumper is to dump the kernel
buffers to stdout if there is no console available to perform the
regular crash output.

However, if ttynull was registered as a console, no crash output was
seen. Commit e23fe90dec28 ("um: kmsg_dumper: always dump when not tty
console") tried to fix this by performing the kmsg_dump unless the
stdio console was behind /dev/console or enabled. But this allowed
kmsg dumping to occur even if other non-stdio consoles will output
the crash output. Also, a console being the driver behind
/dev/console has nothing to do with a crash scenario.

Restore the initial intention by dumping the kernel buffers to stdout
only if a non-ttynull console is registered and enabled. Also add
detailed comments so that it is clear why these rules are applied.
