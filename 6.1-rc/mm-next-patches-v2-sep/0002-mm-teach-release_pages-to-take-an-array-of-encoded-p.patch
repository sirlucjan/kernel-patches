Subject: [PATCH 2/4] mm: teach release_pages() to take an array of encoded
 page pointers too

release_pages() already could take either an array of page pointers, or
an array of folio pointers.  Expand it to also accept an array of
encoded page pointers, which is what both the existing mlock() use and
the upcoming mmu_gather use of encoded page pointers wants.

Note that release_pages() won't actually use, or react to, any extra
encoded bits.  Instead, this is very much a case of "I have walked the
array of encoded pages and done everything the extra bits tell me to do,
now release it all".

Also, while the "either page or folio pointers" dual use was handled
with a cast of the pointer in "release_folios()", this takes a slightly
different approach and uses the "transparent union" attribute to
describe the set of arguments to the function:

  https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Common-Type-Attributes.html

which has been supported by gcc forever, but the kernel hasn't used
before.

That allows us to avoid using various wrappers with casts, and just use
the same function regardless of use.
