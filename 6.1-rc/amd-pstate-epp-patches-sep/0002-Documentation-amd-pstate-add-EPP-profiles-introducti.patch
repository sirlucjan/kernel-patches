Subject: [PATCH 2/8] Documentation: amd-pstate: add EPP profiles introduction

The patch add AMD pstate EPP feature introduction and what EPP
preference supported for AMD processors.

User can get supported list from
energy_performance_available_preferences attribute file, or update
current profile to energy_performance_preference file

1) See all EPP profiles
$ sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_available_preferences
default performance balance_performance balance_power power

2) Check current EPP profile
$ sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference
performance

3) Set new EPP profile
$ sudo bash -c "echo power > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference"
