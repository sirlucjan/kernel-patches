Subject: [PATCH 2/7] block, bfq: fix rq_in_driver check in
 bfq_update_inject_limit

One of the cases where the parameters for injection may be updated is
when there are no more in-flight I/O requests. The number of in-flight
requests is stored in the field bfqd->rq_in_driver of the descriptor
bfqd of the device. So, the controlled condition is
bfqd->rq_in_driver == 0.

Unfortunately, this is wrong because, the instruction that checks this
condition is in the code path that handles the completion of a
request, and, in particular, the instruction is executed before
bfqd->rq_in_driver is decremented in such a code path.

This commit fixes this issue by just replacing 0 with 1 in the
comparison.
