Subject: [PATCH 06/14] block, bfq: split function bfq_better_to_idle

This is a preparatory commit for commits that need to check only one
of the two main reasons for idling. This change should also improve
the quality of the code a little bit, by splitting a function that
contains very long, non-trivial and little related comments.
