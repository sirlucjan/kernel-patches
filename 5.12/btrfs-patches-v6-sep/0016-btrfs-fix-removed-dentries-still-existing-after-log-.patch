Subject: [PATCH 16/23] btrfs: fix removed dentries still existing after log is
 synced

When we move one inode from one directory to another and both the inode
and its previous parent directory were logged before, we are not supposed
to have the dentry for the old parent if we have a power failure after the
log is synced. Only the new dentry is supposed to exist.

Generally this works correctly, however there is a scenario where this is
not currently working, because the old parent of the file/directory that
was moved is not authoritative for a range that includes the dir index and
dir item keys of the old dentry. This case is better explained with the
following example and reproducer:

  # The test requires a very specific layout of keys and items in the
  # fs/subvolume btree to trigger the bug. So we want to make sure that
  # on whatever platform we are, we have the same leaf/node size.
  #
  # Currently in btrfs the node/leaf size can not be smaller than the page
  # size (but it can be greater than the page size). So use the largest
  # supported node/leaf size (64K).

  $ mkfs.btrfs -f -n 65536 /dev/sdc
  $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt

  # "testdir" is inode 257.
  $ mkdir /mnt/testdir
  $ chmod 755 /mnt/testdir

  # Create several empty files to have the directory "testdir" with its
  # items spread over several leaves (7 in this case).
  $ for ((i = 1; i <= 1200; i++)); do
       echo -n > /mnt/testdir/file$i
    done

  # Create our test directory "dira", inode number 1458, which gets all
  # its items in leaf 7.
  #
  # The BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY item for inode 257 ("testdir") that points to
  # the entry named "dira" is in leaf 2, while the BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY
  # item that points to that entry is in leaf 3.
  #
  # For this particular filesystem node size (64K), file count and file
  # names, we endup with the directory entry items from inode 257 in
  # leaves 2 and 3, as previously mentioned - what matters for triggering
  # the bug exercised by this test case is that those items are not placed
  # in leaf 1, they must be placed in a leaf different from the one
  # containing the inode item for inode 257.
  #
  # The corresponding BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY and BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY items for
  # the parent inode (257) are the following:
  #
  #    item 460 key (257 DIR_ITEM 3724298081) itemoff 48344 itemsize 34
  #         location key (1458 INODE_ITEM 0) type DIR
  #         transid 6 data_len 0 name_len 4
  #         name: dira
  #
  # and:
  #
  #    item 771 key (257 DIR_INDEX 1202) itemoff 36673 itemsize 34
  #         location key (1458 INODE_ITEM 0) type DIR
  #         transid 6 data_len 0 name_len 4
  #         name: dira

  $ mkdir /mnt/testdir/dira

  # Make sure everything done so far is durably persisted.
  $ sync

  # Now do a change to inode 257 ("testdir") that does not result in
  # COWing leaves 2 and 3 - the leaves that contain the directory items
  # pointing to inode 1458 (directory "dira").
  #
  # Changing permissions, the owner/group, updating or adding a xattr,
  # etc, will not change (COW) leaves 2 and 3. So for the sake of
  # simplicity change the permissions of inode 257, which results in
  # updating its inode item and therefore change (COW) only leaf 1.

  $ chmod 700 /mnt/testdir

  # Now fsync directory inode 257.
  #
  # Since only the first leaf was changed/COWed, we log the inode item of
  # inode 257 and only the dentries found in the first leaf, all have a
  # key type of BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY, and no keys of type
  # BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY, because they sort after the former type and none
  # exist in the first leaf.
  #
  # We also log 3 items that represent ranges for dir items and dir
  # indexes for which the log is authoritative:
  #
  # 1) a key of type BTRFS_DIR_LOG_ITEM_KEY, which indicates the log is
  #    authoritative for all BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY keys that have an offset
  #    in the range [0, 2285968570] (the offset here is the crc32c of the
  #    dentry's name). The value 2285968570 corresponds to the offset of
  #    the first key of leaf 2 (which is of type BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY);
  #
  # 2) a key of type BTRFS_DIR_LOG_ITEM_KEY, which indicates the log is
  #    authoritative for all BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY keys that have an offset
  #    in the range [4293818216, (u64)-1] (the offset here is the crc32c
  #    of the dentry's name). The value 4293818216 corresponds to the
  #    offset of the highest key of type BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY plus 1
  #    (4293818215 + 1), which is located in leaf 2;
  #
  # 3) a key of type BTRFS_DIR_LOG_INDEX_KEY, with an offset of 1203,
  #    which indicates the log is authoritative for all keys of type
  #    BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY that have an offset in the range
  #    [1203, (u64)-1]. The value 1203 corresponds to the offset of the
  #    last key of type BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY plus 1 (1202 + 1), which is
  #    located in leaf 3;
  #
  # Also, because "testdir" is a directory and inode 1458 ("dira") is a
  # child directory, we log inode 1458 too.

  $ xfs_io -c "fsync" /mnt/testdir

  # Now move "dira", inode 1458, to be a child of the root directory
  # (inode 256).
  #
  # Because this inode was previously logged, when "testdir" was fsynced,
  # the log is updated so that the old inode reference, referring to inode
  # 257 as the parent, is deleted and the new inode reference, referring
  # to inode 256 as the parent, is added to the log.

  $ mv /mnt/testdir/dira /mnt

  # Now change some file and fsync it. This guarantees the log changes
  # made by the previous move/rename operation are persisted. We do not
  # need to do any special modification to the file, just any change to
  # any file and sync the log.

  $ xfs_io -c "pwrite -S 0xab 0 64K" -c "fsync" /mnt/testdir/file1

  # Simulate a power failure and then mount again the filesystem to
  # replay the log tree. We want to verify that we are able to mount the
  # filesystem, meaning log replay was successful, and that directory
  # inode 1458 ("dira") only has inode 256 (the filesystem's root) as
  # its parent (and no longer a child of inode 257).
  #
  # It used to happen that during log replay we would end up having
  # inode 1458 (directory "dira") with 2 hard links, being a child of
  # inode 257 ("testdir") and inode 256 (the filesystem's root). This
  # resulted in the tree checker detecting the issue and causing the
  # mount operation to fail (with -EIO).
  #
  # This happened because in the log we have the new name/parent for
  # inode 1458, which results in adding the new dentry with inode 256
  # as the parent, but the previous dentry, under inode 257 was never
  # removed - this is because the ranges for dir items and dir indexes
  # of inode 257 for which the log is authoritative do not include the
  # old dir item and dir index for the dentry of inode 257 referring to
  # inode 1458:
  #
  # - for dir items, the log is authoritative for the ranges
  #   [0, 2285968570] and [4293818216, (u64)-1]. The dir item at inode 257
  #   pointing to inode 1458 has a key of (257 DIR_ITEM 3724298081), as
  #   previously mentioned, so the dir item is not deleted when the log
  #   replay procedure processes the authoritative ranges, as 3724298081
  #   is outside both ranges;
  #
  # - for dir indexes, the log is authoritative for the range
  #   [1203, (u64)-1], and the dir index item of inode 257 pointing to
  #   inode 1458 has a key of (257 DIR_INDEX 1202), as previously
  #   mentioned, so the dir index item is not deleted when the log
  #   replay procedure processes the authoritative range.

In this example the inode we moved was a directory, so it was easy to
detect the problem because directories can only have one hard link and
the tree checker immediately detects that. If the moved inode was a file,
then the log replay would succeed and we would end up having both the
new hard link (/mnt/foo) and the old hard link (/mnt/testdir/foo) present,
but only the new one should be present.

Fix this by forcing re-logging of the old parent directory when logging
the new name during a rename operation. This ensures we end up with a log
that is authoritative for a range covering the keys for the old dentry,
therefore causing the old dentry do be deleted when replaying the log.

A test case for fstests will follow up soon.
