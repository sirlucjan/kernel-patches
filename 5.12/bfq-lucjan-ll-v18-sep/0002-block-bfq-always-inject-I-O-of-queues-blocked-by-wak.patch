Subject: [PATCH 02/73] block, bfq: always inject I/O of queues blocked by
 wakers

Suppose that I/O dispatch is plugged, to wait for new I/O for the
in-service bfq-queue, say bfqq.  Suppose then that there is a further
bfq_queue woken by bfqq, and that this woken queue has pending I/O. A
woken queue does not steal bandwidth from bfqq, because it remains
soon without I/O if bfqq is not served. So there is virtually no risk
of loss of bandwidth for bfqq if this woken queue has I/O dispatched
while bfqq is waiting for new I/O. In contrast, this extra I/O
injection boosts throughput. This commit performs this extra
injection.
