Subject: [PATCH 07/67] bfq: silence lockdep for bfqd/ioc lock inversion

lockdep warns of circular locking due to inversion between
bfq_insert_requests and bfq_exit_icq. If we end freeing a request when
merging, we *may* grab an ioc->lock if that request is the last refcount
to that ioc. bfq_bio_merge also potentially could have this ordering.
bfq_exit_icq, conversely, grabs bfqd but is always called with ioc->lock
held.

bfq_exit_icq may either be called from put_io_context_active with ioc
refcount raised, ioc_release_fn after the last refcount was already
dropped, or ioc_clear_queue, which is only called while queue is
quiesced or exiting, so the inverted orderings should never conflict.

Fixes: aee69d78dec0 ("block, bfq: introduce the BFQ-v0 I/O scheduler as
an extra scheduler")
