Subject: [PATCH 61/67] block, bfq: fix delayed stable merge check

When attempting to schedule a merge of a given bfq_queue with the currently
in-service bfq_queue or with a cooperating bfq_queue among the scheduled
bfq_queues, delayed stable merge is checked for rotational or non-queueing
devs. For this stable merge to be performed, some conditions must be met.
If the current bfq_queue underwent some split from some merged bfq_queue,
one of these conditions is that two hundred milliseconds must elapse from
split, otherwise this condition is always met.

Unfortunately, by mistake, time_is_after_jiffies() was written instead of
time_is_before_jiffies() for this check, verifying that less than two
hundred milliseconds have elapsed instead of verifying that at least two
hundred milliseconds have elapsed.

Fix this issue by replacing time_is_after_jiffies() with
time_is_before_jiffies().
