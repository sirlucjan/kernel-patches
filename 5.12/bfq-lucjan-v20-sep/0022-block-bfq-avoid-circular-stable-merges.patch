Subject: [PATCH 22/67] block, bfq: avoid circular stable merges

BFQ may merge a new bfq_queue, stably, with the last bfq_queue
created. In particular, BFQ first waits a little bit for some I/O to
flow inside the new queue, say Q2, if this is needed to understand
whether it is better or worse to merge Q2 with the last queue created,
say Q1. This delayed stable merge is performed by assigning
bic->stable_merge_bfqq = Q1, for the bic associated with Q1.

Yet, while waiting for some I/O to flow in Q2, a non-stable queue
merge of Q2 with Q1 may happen, causing the bic previously associated
with Q2 to be associated with exactly Q1 (bic->bfqq = Q1). After that,
Q2 and Q1 may happen to be split, and, in the split, Q1 may happen to
be recycled as a non-shared bfq_queue. In that case, Q1 may then
happen to undergo a stable merge with the bfq_queue pointed by
bic->stable_merge_bfqq. Yet bic->stable_merge_bfqq still points to
Q1. So Q1 would be merged with itself.

This commit fixes this error by intercepting this situation, and
canceling the schedule of the stable merge.
