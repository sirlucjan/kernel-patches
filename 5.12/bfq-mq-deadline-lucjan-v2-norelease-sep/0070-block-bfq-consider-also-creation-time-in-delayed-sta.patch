Subject: [PATCH 070/100] block, bfq: consider also creation time in delayed
 stable merge

Since commit 430a67f9d616 ("block, bfq: merge bursts of newly-created
queues"), BFQ may schedule a merge between a newly created sync
bfq_queue and the last sync bfq_queue created. Such a merging is not
performed immediately, because BFQ needs first to find out whether the
newly created queue actually reaches a higher throughput if not merged
at all (and in that case BFQ will not perform any stable merging). To
check that, a little time must be waited after the creation of the new
queue, so that some I/O can flow in the queue, and statistics on such
I/O can be computed.

Yet, to evaluate the above waiting time, the last split time is
considered as start time, instead of the creation time of the
queue. This is a mistake, because considering the split time is
correct only in the following scenario.

The queue undergoes a non-stable merges on the arrival of its very
first I/O request, due to close I/O with some other queue. While the
queue is merged for close I/O, stable merging is not considered. Yet
the queue may then happen to be split, if the close I/O finishes (or
happens to be a false positive). From this time on, the queue can
again be considered for stable merging. But, again, a little time must
elapse, to let some new I/O flow in the queue and to get updated
statistics. To wait for this time, the split time is to be taken into
account.

Yet, if the queue does not undergo a non-stable merge on the arrival
of its very first request, then BFQ immediately checks whether the
stable merge is to be performed. It happens because the split time for
a queue is initialized to minus infinity when the queue is created.

This commit fixes this mistake by adding the missing condition. Now
the check for delayed stable-merge is performed after a little time is
elapsed not only from the last queue split time, but also from the
creation time of the queue.
