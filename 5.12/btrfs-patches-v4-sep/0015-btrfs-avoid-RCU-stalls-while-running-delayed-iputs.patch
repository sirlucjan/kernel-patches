Subject: [PATCH 15/16] btrfs: avoid RCU stalls while running delayed iputs

Generally a delayed iput is added when we might do the final iput, so
usually we'll end up sleeping while processing the delayed iputs
naturally.  However there's no guarantee of this, especially for small
files.  In production we noticed 5 instances of RCU stalls while testing
a kernel release overnight across 1000 machines, so this is relatively
common.

Fix this by adding a cond_resched_lock() to the loop processing delayed
iputs so we can avoid these sort of stalls.
