Subject: [PATCH 04/18] block, bfq: keep shared queues out of the waker
 mechanism

Shared queues are likely to receive I/O at a high rate. This may
deceptively let them be considered as wakers of other queues. But a
false waker will unjustly steal bandwidth to its supposedly woken
queue. So considering also shared queues in the waking mechanism may
cause more control troubles than throughput benefits. This commit
keeps shared queues out of the waker-detection mechanism.
