Subject: [PATCH 07/21] btrfs: check worker before need_preemptive_reclaim

need_preemptive_reclaim() does some calculations, which aren't heavy,
but if we're already running preemptive reclaim there's no reason to do
them at all, so re-order the checks so that we don't do the calculation
if we're already doing reclaim.
