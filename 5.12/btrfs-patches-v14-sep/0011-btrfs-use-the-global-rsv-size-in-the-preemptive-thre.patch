Subject: [PATCH 11/21] btrfs: use the global rsv size in the preemptive thresh
 calculation

We calculate the amount of "free" space available for normal
reservations by taking the total space and subtracting out the hard used
space, which is readonly, used, and reserved space.  However we weren't
taking into account the global block rsv, which is essentially hard used
space.  Handle this by subtracting it from the available free space, so
that our threshold more closely mirrors reality.

[HH: small context fix for 5.10.x]
