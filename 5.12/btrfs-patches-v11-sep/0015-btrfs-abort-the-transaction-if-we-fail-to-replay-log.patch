Subject: [PATCH 15/21] btrfs: abort the transaction if we fail to replay log
 trees

During inspection of the return path for replay I noticed that we don't
actually abort the transaction if we get a failure during replay.  This
isn't a problem necessarily, as we properly return the error and will
fail to mount.  However we still leave this dangling transaction that
could conceivably be committed without thinking there was an error.
Handle this by making sure we abort the transaction on error to
safeguard us from any problems in the future.
