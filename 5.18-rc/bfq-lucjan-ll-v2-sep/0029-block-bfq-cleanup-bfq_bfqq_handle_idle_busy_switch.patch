Subject: [PATCH 29/34] block, bfq: cleanup bfq_bfqq_handle_idle_busy_switch()

'wr_or_deserves_wr' is only used in bfq_update_bfqq_wr_on_rq_arrival(),
which is only called from bfq_bfqq_handle_idle_busy_switch() in specific
code branch, thus there is no need to precaculate 'wr_or_deserves_wr'
each time bfq_bfqq_handle_idle_busy_switch() is called.
