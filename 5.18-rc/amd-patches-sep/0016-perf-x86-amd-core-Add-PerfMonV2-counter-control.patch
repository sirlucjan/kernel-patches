Subject: [PATCH 16/32] perf/x86/amd/core: Add PerfMonV2 counter control

If AMD Performance Monitoring Version 2 (PerfMonV2) is
supported, use a new scheme to manage the Core PMCs using
the new global control and status registers. This will be
bypassed on unsupported hardware (x86_pmu.version < 2).

Currently, all PMCs have dedicated control (PERF_CTL) and
counter (PERF_CTR) registers. For a given PMC, the enable
(En) bit of its PERF_CTL register is used to start or stop
counting.

The Performance Counter Global Control (PerfCntrGlobalCtl)
register has enable (PerfCntrEn) bits for each PMC. For a
PMC to start counting, both PERF_CTL and PerfCntrGlobalCtl
enable bits must be set. If either of those are cleared,
the PMC stops counting.

In x86_pmu_{en,dis}able_all(), the PERF_CTL registers of
all active PMCs are written to in a loop. Ideally, PMCs
counting the same event that were started and stopped at
the same time should record the same counts. Due to delays
in between writes to the PERF_CTL registers across loop
iterations, the PMCs cannot be enabled or disabled at the
same instant and hence, record slightly different counts.
This is fixed by enabling or disabling all active PMCs at
the same time with a single write to the PerfCntrGlobalCtl
register.
