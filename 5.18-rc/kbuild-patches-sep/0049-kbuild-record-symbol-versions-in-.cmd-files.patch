Subject: [PATCH 49/63] kbuild: record symbol versions in *.cmd files

When CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y, the output from genksyms is saved in
separate *.symversions files, and will be used much later when
CONFIG_LTO_CLANG=y because it is impossible to update LLVM bit code
here.

This approach is not robust because:

 - *.symversions may or may not exist. If *.symversions does not
   exist, we never know if it is missing for legitimate reason
   (i.e. no EXPORT_SYMBOL) or something bad has happened (for
   example, the user accidentally deleted it). Once it occurs,
   it is not self-healing because *.symversions is generated
   as a side effect.

 - stale (i.e. invalid) *.symversions might be picked up if an
   object is generated in a non-ordinary way, and corresponding
   *.symversions (, which was generated by old builds) just happen
   to exist.

A more robust approach is to save symbol versions in *.cmd files
because:

 - *.cmd always exists (if the object is generated by if_changed
   rule or friends). Even if the user accidentally deletes it,
   it will be regenerated in the next build.

 - *.cmd is always re-generated when the object is updated. This
   avoid stale version information being picked up.

I will remove *.symversions later.
