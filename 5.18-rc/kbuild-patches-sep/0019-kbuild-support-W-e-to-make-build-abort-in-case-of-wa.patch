Subject: [PATCH 19/63] kbuild: support W=e to make build abort in case of
 warning

When developing new code/feature, CONFIG_WERROR is most
often turned off, especially for people using make W=12 to
get more warnings.

In such case, turning on -Werror temporarily would require
switching on CONFIG_WERROR in the configuration, building,
then switching off CONFIG_WERROR.

For this use case, this patch introduces a new 'e' modifier
to W= as a short hand for KCFLAGS+=-Werror" so that -Werror
got added to the kernel (built-in) and modules' CFLAGS.
