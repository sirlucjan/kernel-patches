Subject: [PATCH 21/25] workqueue: Restrict kworker in the offline CPU pool
 running on housekeeping CPUs

When a CPU is going offline, all workers on the CPU's pool will have their
cpus_allowed cleared to cpu_possible_mask and can run on any CPUs including
the isolated ones. Instead, set cpus_allowed to wq_unbound_cpumask so that
the can avoid isolated CPUs.
