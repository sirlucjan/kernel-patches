Subject: [PATCH 33/44] x86: kmsan: skip shadow checks in __switch_to()

When instrumenting functions, KMSAN obtains the per-task state (mostly
pointers to metadata for function arguments and return values) once per
function at its beginning, using the `current` pointer.

Every time the instrumented function calls another function, this state
(`struct kmsan_context_state`) is updated with shadow/origin data of the
passed and returned values.

When `current` changes in the low-level arch code, instrumented code can
not notice that, and will still refer to the old state, possibly corrupting
it or using stale data. This may result in false positive reports.

To deal with that, we need to apply __no_kmsan_checks to the functions
performing context switching - this will result in skipping all KMSAN
shadow checks and marking newly created values as initialized,
preventing all false positive reports in those functions. False negatives
are still possible, but we expect them to be rare and impersistent.
