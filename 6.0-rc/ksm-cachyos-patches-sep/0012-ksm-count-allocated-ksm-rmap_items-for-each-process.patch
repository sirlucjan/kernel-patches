Subject: [PATCH 12/12] ksm: count allocated ksm rmap_items for each process
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

KSM can save memory by merging identical pages, but also can consume
additional memory, because it needs to generate rmap_items to save
each scanned page's brief rmap information. Some of these pages may
be merged, but some may not be abled to be merged after being checked
several times, which are unprofitable memory consumed.

The information about whether KSM save memory or consume memory in
system-wide range can be determined by the comprehensive calculation
of pages_sharing, pages_shared, pages_unshared and pages_volatile.
A simple approximate calculation:

	profit ≈ pages_sharing * sizeof(page) - (all_rmap_items) *
	         sizeof(rmap_item);

where all_rmap_items equals to the sum of pages_sharing, pages_shared,
pages_unshared and pages_volatile.

But we cannot calculate this kind of ksm profit inner single-process wide
because the information of ksm rmap_item's number of a process is lacked.
For user applications, if this kind of information could be obtained,
it helps upper users know how beneficial the ksm-policy (like madvise)
they are using brings, and then optimize their app code. For example,
one application madvise 1000 pages as MERGEABLE, while only a few pages
are really merged, then it's not cost-efficient.

So we add a new interface /proc/<pid>/ksm_alloced_items for each
process to indicate the total allocated ksm rmap_items of this process.
