Subject: [PATCH 07/44] kmsan: introduce __no_sanitize_memory and
 __no_kmsan_checks

__no_sanitize_memory is a function attribute that instructs KMSAN to
skip a function during instrumentation. This is needed to e.g. implement
the noinstr functions.

__no_kmsan_checks is a function attribute that makes KMSAN
ignore the uninitialized values coming from the function's
inputs, and initialize the function's outputs.

Functions marked with this attribute can't be inlined into functions
not marked with it, and vice versa. This behavior is overridden by
__always_inline.

__SANITIZE_MEMORY__ is a macro that's defined iff the file is
instrumented with KMSAN. This is not the same as CONFIG_KMSAN, which is
defined for every file.
