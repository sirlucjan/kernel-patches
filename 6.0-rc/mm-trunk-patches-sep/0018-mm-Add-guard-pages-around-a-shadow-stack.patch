Subject: [PATCH 18/39] mm: Add guard pages around a shadow stack.

The architecture of shadow stack constrains the ability of userspace to
move the shadow stack pointer (SSP) in order to  prevent corrupting or
switching to other shadow stacks. The RSTORSSP can move the spp to
different shadow stacks, but it requires a specially placed token in order
to do this. However, the architecture does not prevent incrementing the
stack pointer to wander onto an adjacent shadow stack. To prevent this in
software, enforce guard pages at the beginning of shadow stack vmas, such
that there will always be a gap between adjacent shadow stacks.

Make the gap big enough so that no userspace SSP changing operations
(besides RSTORSSP), can move the SSP from one stack to the next. The
SSP can increment or decrement by CALL, RET  and INCSSP. CALL and RET
can move the SSP by a maximum of 8 bytes, at which point the shadow
stack would be accessed.

The INCSSP instruction can also increment the shadow stack pointer. It
is the shadow stack analog of an instruction like:

	addq    $0x80, %rsp

However, there is one important difference between an ADD on %rsp and
INCSSP. In addition to modifying SSP, INCSSP also reads from the memory
of the first and last elements that were "popped". It can be thought of
as acting like this:

READ_ONCE(ssp);       // read+discard top element on stack
ssp += nr_to_pop * 8; // move the shadow stack
READ_ONCE(ssp-8);     // read+discard last popped stack element

The maximum distance INCSSP can move the SSP is 2040 bytes, before it
would read the memory. Therefore a single page gap will be enough to
prevent any operation from shifting the SSP to an adjacent stack, since
it would have to land in the gap at least once, causing a fault.

This could be accomplished by using VM_GROWSDOWN, but this has a
downside. The behavior would allow shadow stack's to grow, which is
unneeded and adds a strange difference to how most regular stacks work.
