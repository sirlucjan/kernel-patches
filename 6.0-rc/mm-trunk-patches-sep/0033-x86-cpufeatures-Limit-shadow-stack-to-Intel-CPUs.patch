Subject: [PATCH 33/39] x86/cpufeatures: Limit shadow stack to Intel CPUs

Shadow stack is supported on newer AMD processors, but the kernel
implementation has not been tested on them. Prevent basic issues from
showing up for normal users by disabling shadow stack on all CPUs except
Intel until it has been tested. At which point the limitation should be
removed.
