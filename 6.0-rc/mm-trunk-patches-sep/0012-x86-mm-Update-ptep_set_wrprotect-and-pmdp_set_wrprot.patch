Subject: [PATCH 12/39] x86/mm: Update ptep_set_wrprotect() and
 pmdp_set_wrprotect() for transition from _PAGE_DIRTY to _PAGE_COW

When Shadow Stack is in use, Write=0,Dirty=1 PTE are reserved for shadow
stack. Copy-on-write PTes then have Write=0,Cow=1.

When a PTE goes from Write=1,Dirty=1 to Write=0,Cow=1, it could
become a transient shadow stack PTE in two cases:

The first case is that some processors can start a write but end up seeing
a Write=0 PTE by the time they get to the Dirty bit, creating a transient
shadow stack PTE. However, this will not occur on processors supporting
Shadow Stack, and a TLB flush is not necessary.

The second case is that when _PAGE_DIRTY is replaced with _PAGE_COW non-
atomically, a transient shadow stack PTE can be created as a result.
Thus, prevent that with cmpxchg.

Dave Hansen, Jann Horn, Andy Lutomirski, and Peter Zijlstra provided many
insights to the issue.  Jann Horn provided the cmpxchg solution.
