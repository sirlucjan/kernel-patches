Subject: [PATCH 02/11] ZEN: mm: Lower the non-hugetlbpage pageblock size to
 reduce scheduling delays

The page allocator processes free pages in groups of pageblocks, where
the size of a pageblock is typically quite large (1024 pages without
hugetlbpage support). Pageblocks are processed atomically with the zone
lock held, which can cause severe scheduling delays on both the CPU
going through the pageblock and any other CPUs waiting to acquire the
zone lock. A frequent offender is move_freepages_block(), which is used
by rmqueue() for page allocation.

As it turns out, there's no requirement for pageblocks to be so large,
so the pageblock order can simply be reduced to ease the scheduling
delays and zone lock contention. PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER is used as a
reasonable setting to ensure non-costly page allocation requests can
still be serviced without always needing to free up more than one
pageblock's worth of pages at a time.

This has a noticeable effect on overall system latency when memory
pressure is elevated. The various mm functions which operate on
pageblocks no longer appear in the preemptoff tracer, where previously
they would spend up to 100 ms on a mobile arm64 CPU processing a
pageblock with preemption disabled and the zone lock held.

Subject: [PATCH 03/11] mm: vmscan: fix extreme overreclaim and swap floods

During proactive reclaim, we sometimes observe severe overreclaim, with
several thousand times more pages reclaimed than requested.

This trace was obtained from shrink_lruvec() during such an instance:

    prio:0 anon_cost:1141521 file_cost:7767
    nr_reclaimed:4387406 nr_to_reclaim:1047 (or_factor:4190)
    nr=[7161123 345 578 1111]

While he reclaimer requested 4M, vmscan reclaimed close to 16G, most of it
by swapping.  These requests take over a minute, during which the write()
to memory.reclaim is unkillably stuck inside the kernel.

Digging into the source, this is caused by the proportional reclaim
bailout logic.  This code tries to resolve a fundamental conflict: to
reclaim roughly what was requested, while also aging all LRUs fairly and
in accordance to their size, swappiness, refault rates etc.  The way it
attempts fairness is that once the reclaim goal has been reached, it stops
scanning the LRUs with the smaller remaining scan targets, and adjusts the
remainder of the bigger LRUs according to how much of the smaller LRUs was
scanned.  It then finishes scanning that remainder regardless of the
reclaim goal.

This works fine if priority levels are low and the LRU lists are
comparable in size.  However, in this instance, the cgroup that is
targeted by proactive reclaim has almost no files left - they've already
been squeezed out by proactive reclaim earlier - and the remaining anon
pages are hot.  Anon rotations cause the priority level to drop to 0,
which results in reclaim targeting all of anon (a lot) and all of file
(almost nothing).  By the time reclaim decides to bail, it has scanned
most or all of the file target, and therefor must also scan most or all of
the enormous anon target.  This target is thousands of times larger than
the reclaim goal, thus causing the overreclaim.

The bailout code hasn't changed in years, why is this failing now?  The
most likely explanations are two other recent changes in anon reclaim:

1. Before the series starting with commit 5df741963d52 ("mm: fix LRU
   balancing effect of new transparent huge pages"), the VM was
   overall relatively reluctant to swap at all, even if swap was
   configured. This means the LRU balancing code didn't come into play
   as often as it does now, and mostly in high pressure situations
   where pronounced swap activity wouldn't be as surprising.

2. For historic reasons, shrink_lruvec() loops on the scan targets of
   all LRU lists except the active anon one, meaning it would bail if
   the only remaining pages to scan were active anon - even if there
   were a lot of them.

   Before the series starting with commit ccc5dc67340c ("mm/vmscan:
   make active/inactive ratio as 1:1 for anon lru"), most anon pages
   would live on the active LRU; the inactive one would contain only a
   handful of preselected reclaim candidates. After the series, anon
   gets aged similarly to file, and the inactive list is the default
   for new anon pages as well, making it often the much bigger list.

   As a result, the VM is now more likely to actually finish large
   anon targets than before.

Change the code such that only one SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX-sized nudge toward the
larger LRU lists is made before bailing out on a met reclaim goal.

This fixes the extreme overreclaim problem.

Fairness is more subtle and harder to evaluate.  No obvious misbehavior
was observed on the test workload, in any case.  Conceptually, fairness
should primarily be a cumulative effect from regular, lower priority
scans.  Once the VM is in trouble and needs to escalate scan targets to
make forward progress, fairness needs to take a backseat.  This is also
acknowledged by the myriad exceptions in get_scan_count().  This patch
makes fairness decrease gradually, as it keeps fairness work static over
increasing priority levels with growing scan targets.  This should make
more sense - although we may have to re-visit the exact values.

This warning isn't very useful: why would you put ANNOTATE_NOENDBR on
ENDBR, and if you did, what's the harm?

And thus far it's only found one non-bug, where the
'__end_entry_SYSENTER_compat' label happens to land on the ENDBR from
entry_SYSCALL_compat:

  vmlinux.o: warning: objtool: entry_SYSCALL_compat+0x0: ANNOTATE_NOENDBR on ENDBR

.. which is fine.  Just remove the warning.

+
+Overview
+========
+
+.. note::
+	The examples below use ``<LED>`` to refer to the name of a
+	system-specific LED.  If no suitable LED is available on a test
+	system (in a virtual machine, for example), it is possible to
+	use a userspace LED.  (See ``Documentation/leds/uleds.rst``.)
+
+Verify that the ``blkdev`` LED trigger is available::
+
+	# grep blkdev /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
+	... rfkill-none blkdev
+
+(If the previous command produces no output, you may need to load the trigger
+module - ``modprobe ledtrig_blkdev``.  If the module is not available, check
+the value of ``CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV`` in your kernel configuration.)
+
+Associate the LED with the ``blkdev`` LED trigger::
+
+	# echo blkdev > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
+
+	# cat /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
+	... rfkill-none [blkdev]
+
+Note that several new device attributes are available in the
+``/sys/class/leds/<LED>`` directory.
+
+* ``link_dev_by_path`` and ``unlink_dev_by_path`` are used to manage the set of
+  block devices associated with this LED.  The LED will blink in response to
+  read or write activity on its linked devices.
+
+* ``blink_on_read``, ``blink_on_write``, ``blink_on_discard``, and
+  ``blink_on_flush`` are boolean values that determine whether the LED will
+  blink when a particular type of activity is detected on one of its linked
+  block devices.
+
+* ``blink_time`` is the duration (in milliseconds) of each blink of this LED.
+  (The minimum value is 10 milliseconds.)
+
+* ``check_interval`` is the frequency (in milliseconds) with which block devices
+  linked to this LED will be checked for activity and the LED blinked (if the
+  correct type of activity has occurred).
+
+* The ``linked_devices`` directory will contain a symbolic link to every device
+  that is associated with this LED.
+
+Link a block device to the LED::
+
+	# echo /dev/sda > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/link_dev_by_path
+
+	# ls /sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices
+	sda
+
+(The value written to ``link_dev_by_path`` must be the path of the device
+special file, such as ``/dev/sda``, that represents the block device - or the
+path of a symbolic link to such a device special file.)
+
+Activity on the device will now cause the LED to blink.  The duration of each
+blink (in milliseconds) can be adjusted by setting
+``/sys/class/leds/<LED>/blink_time``.  (But see **check_interval and
+blink_time** below.)
+
+Associate a second device with the LED::
+
+	# echo /dev/sdb > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/link_dev_by_path
+
+	# ls /sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices
+	sda  sdb
+
+When a block device is linked to one or more LEDs, the LEDs are linked from
+the device's ``linked_leds`` directory::
+
+	# ls /sys/class/block/sd{a,b}/linked_leds
+	/sys/class/block/sda/linked_leds:
+	<LED>
+
+	/sys/class/block/sdb/linked_leds:
+	<LED>
+
+(The ``linked_leds`` directory only exists when the block device is linked to
+at least one LED.)
+
+``check_interval`` and ``blink_time``
+=====================================
+
+* By default, linked block devices are checked for activity every 100
+  milliseconds.  This frequency can be changed for an LED via the
+  ``/sys/class/leds/<led>/check_interval`` attribute.  (The minimum value is 25
+  milliseconds.)
+
+* All block devices associated with an LED are checked for activity every
+  ``check_interval`` milliseconds, and a blink is triggered if the correct type
+  of activity (as determined by the LED's ``blink_on_*`` attributes) is
+  detected.  The duration of an LED's blink is determined by its ``blink_time``
+  attribute.  Thus (when the correct type of activity is detected), the LED will
+  be on for ``blink_time`` milliseconds and off for
+  ``check_interval - blink_time`` milliseconds.
+
+* The LED subsystem ignores new blink requests for an LED that is already in
+  in the process of blinking, so setting a ``blink_time`` greater than or equal
+  to ``check_interval`` will cause some blinks to be missed.
+
+* Because of processing times, scheduling latencies, etc., avoiding missed
+  blinks actually requires a difference of at least a few milliseconds between
+  the ``blink_time`` and ``check_interval``.  The required difference is likely
+  to vary from system to system.  As a  reference, a Thecus N5550 NAS requires a
+  difference of 7 milliseconds (e.g. ``check_interval == 100``,
+  ``blink_time == 93``).
+
+* The default values (``check_interval == 100``, ``blink_time == 75``) cause the
+  LED associated with a continuously active device to blink rapidly.  For a more
+  "always on" effect, increase the ``blink_time`` (but not too much; see the
+  previous bullet).
+
+Other Notes
+===========
+
+* Many (possibly all) types of block devices work with this trigger, including:
+
+  * SCSI (including SATA and USB) hard disk drives and SSDs
+  * SCSI (including SATA and USB) optical drives
+  * NVMe SSDs
+  * SD cards
+  * loopback block devices (``/dev/loop*``)
+  * device mapper devices, such as LVM logical volumes
+  * MD RAID devices
+  * zRAM compressed RAM-disks
+  * partitions on block devics that support them
+
+* The names of the symbolic links in ``/sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices``
+  are **kernel** names, which may not match the paths used for
+  ``link_dev_by_path`` and ``unlink_dev_by_path``.  This is most likely when a
+  symbolic link is used to refer to the device (as is common with logical
+  volumes), but it can be true for any device, because nothing prevents the
+  creation of device special files with arbitrary names (e.g.
+  ``sudo mknod /foo b 8 0``).
+
+* The ``blkdev`` LED trigger supports many-to-many device/LED associations.
+  A device can be associated with multiple LEDs, and an LED can be associated
+  with multiple devices.

+/**
+ * DOC: Overview
+ *
+ * The ``blkdev`` LED trigger works by periodically checking the activity
+ * counters of block devices that have been linked to one or more LEDs and
+ * blinking those LED(s) if the correct type of activity has occurred.  The
+ * periodic check is scheduled with the Linux kernel's deferred work facility.
+ *
+ * Trigger-specific data about block devices and LEDs is stored in two data
+ * structures --- &struct blkdev_trig_bdev (a "BTB") and &struct blkdev_trig_led
+ * (a "BTL").  Each structure contains a &struct xarray that holds links to any
+ * linked devices of the other type.  I.e. &blkdev_trig_bdev.linked_btls
+ * contains links to all BTLs whose LEDs have been linked to the BTB's block
+ * device, and &blkdev_trig_led.linked_btbs contains links to all BTBs whose
+ * block devices have been linked to the BTL's LED.  Thus, a block device can
+ * be linked to more than one LED, and an LED can be linked to more than one
+ * block device.

From b0e3c238686d7d8d2b69d10fc321509c9c2066fd Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001

Subject: [PATCH 07/11] sched/all: Change all BUG_ON() instances in the
 scheduler to WARN_ON_ONCE()

There's no good reason to crash a user's system with a BUG_ON(),
chances are high that they'll never even see the crash message on
Xorg, and it won't make it into the syslog either.

By using a WARN_ON_ONCE() we at least give the user a chance to report
any bugs triggered here - instead of getting silent hangs.

None of these WARN_ON_ONCE()s are supposed to trigger, ever - so we ignore
cases where a NULL check is done via a BUG_ON() and we let a NULL
pointer through after a WARN_ON_ONCE().

There's one exception: WARN_ON_ONCE() arguments with side-effects,
such as locking - in this case we use the return value of the
WARN_ON_ONCE(), such as in:

 -       BUG_ON(!lock_task_sighand(p, &flags));
 +       if (WARN_ON_ONCE(!lock_task_sighand(p, &flags)))
 +               return;

When a CPU comes online, the per-CPU NB and LLC uncore contexts are
freed but not the events array within the context structure. This
causes a memory leak as identified by the kmemleak detector.

Fix the problem by freeing the events array before freeing the uncore

Subject: [PATCH 11/11] zram: don't retry compress incompressible page

It doesn't make sense for us to retry to compress an uncompressible page
(comp_len == PAGE_SIZE) in zsmalloc slowpath, because we will be storing
it uncompressed anyway.  We can avoid wasting time on another compression
attempt.  It is enough to take lock (zcomp_stream_get) and execute the
code below.
