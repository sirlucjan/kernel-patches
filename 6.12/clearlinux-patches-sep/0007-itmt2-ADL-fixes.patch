Subject: [PATCH 07/16] itmt2 ADL fixes

On systems with overclocking enabled, CPPC Highest Performance can be
hard coded to 0xff. In this case even if we have cores with different
highest performance, ITMT can't be enabled as the current implementation
depends on CPPC Highest Performance.

On such systems we can use MSR_HWP_CAPABILITIES maximum performance field
when CPPC.Highest Performance is 0xff.

Due to legacy reasons, we can't solely depend on MSR_HWP_CAPABILITIES as
in some older systems CPPC Highest Performance is the only way to identify
different performing cores.
