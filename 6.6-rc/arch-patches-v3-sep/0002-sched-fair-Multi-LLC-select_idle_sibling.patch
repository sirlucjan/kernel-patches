Subject: [PATCH 2/9] sched/fair: Multi-LLC select_idle_sibling()

Tejun reported that when he targets workqueues towards a specific LLC
on his Zen2 machine with 3 cores / LLC and 4 LLCs in total, he gets
significant idle time.

This is, of course, because of how select_idle_sibling() will not
consider anything outside of the local LLC, and since all these tasks
are short running the periodic idle load balancer is ineffective.

And while it is good to keep work cache local, it is better to not
have significant idle time. Therefore, have select_idle_sibling() try
other LLCs inside the same node when the local one comes up empty.
