+Advisor
+=======
+
+The number of candidate pages for KSM is dynamic. It can be often observed
+that during the startup of an application more candidate pages need to be
+processed. Without an advisor the ``pages_to_scan`` parameter needs to be
+sized for the maximum number of candidate pages. The scan time advisor can
+changes the ``pages_to_scan`` parameter based on demand.
+
+The advisor can be enabled so KSM can automatically adapt to changes in the
+number of candidate pages to scan. Two advisors are implemented: 0 (None) and
+1 (Scan time). With None no advisor is enabled. The default is None.
+
+The Scan time advisor changes the ``pages_to_scan`` parameter based on the
+observed scan times. The possible values for the ``pages_to_scan`` parameter is
+limited by the ``advisor_min_pages`` and ``advisor_max_pages`` parameters. In
+addition there is also the ``advisor_target_scan_time`` parameter. This
+parameter sets the target time to scan all the KSM candidate pages. The
+parameter ``advisor_target_scan_time`` decides how aggressive the scan time
+advisor scans candidate pages. Lower values make the scan time advisor to scan
+more aggresively. This is the most important parameter for the configuration of
+the scan time advisor.
+
+The ``pages_to_scan`` parameter is re-calculated after a scan has been completed.
