Subject: [PATCH 1/4] mm/ksm: add ksm advisor

This adds the ksm advisor. The ksm advisor automatically manages the
pages_to_scan setting to achieve a target scan time. The target scan
time defines how many seconds it should take to scan all the candidate
KSM pages. In other words the pages_to_scan rate is changed by the
advisor to achieve the target scan time. The algorithm has a max and min
value to:
- guarantee responsiveness to changes
- limit CPU resource consumption

The respective parameters are:
- ksm_advisor_target_scan_time (how many seconds a scan should take)
- ksm_advisor_max_cpu (maximum value for cpu percent usage)

- ksm_advisor_min_pages (minimum value for pages_to_scan per batch)
- ksm_advisor_max_pages (maximum value for pages_to_scan per batch)

The algorithm calculates the change value based on the target scan time
and the previous scan time. To avoid pertubations an exponentially
weighted moving average is applied.

The advisor is managed by two main parameters: target scan time,
cpu max time for the ksmd background thread. These parameters determine
how aggresive ksmd scans.

In addition there are min and max values for the pages_to_scan parameter
to make sure that its initial and max values are not set too low or too
high. This ensures that it is able to react to changes quickly enough.

The default values are:
- target scan time: 200 secs
- max cpu: 70%
- min pages: 500
- max pages: 30000

By default the advisor is disabled. Currently there are two advisors:
none and scan-time.

Tests with various workloads have shown considerable CPU savings. Most
of the workloads I have investigated have more candidate pages during
startup, once the workload is stable in terms of memory, the number of
candidate pages is reduced. Without the advisor, the pages_to_scan needs
to be sized for the maximum number of candidate pages. So having this
advisor definitely helps in reducing CPU consumption.

For the instagram workload, the advisor achieves a 25% CPU reduction.
Once the memory is stable, the pages_to_scan parameter gets reduced to
about 40% of its max value.
