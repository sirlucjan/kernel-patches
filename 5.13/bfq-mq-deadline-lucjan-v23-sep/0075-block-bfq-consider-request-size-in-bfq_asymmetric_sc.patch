Subject: [PATCH 075/114] block, bfq: consider request size in
 bfq_asymmetric_scenario()

There is a special case when bfq do not need to idle when more than
one groups is active:

 1) all active queues have the same weight,
 2) all active queues have the same request size.
 3) all active queues belong to the same I/O-priority class,

Each time a request is dispatched, bfq can switch in service queue
safely, since the throughput of each active queue is guaranteed to
be equivalent.

Test procedure:
run "fio -numjobs=1 -ioengine=psync -bs=4k -direct=1 -rw=randread..." in
different cgroup(not root).

Test result: total bandwidth(Mib/s)
| total jobs | before this patch | after this patch      |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 1          | 33.8              | 33.8                  |
| 2          | 33.8              | 65.4 (32.7 each job)  |
| 4          | 33.8              | 106.8 (26.7 each job) |
| 8          | 33.8              | 126.4 (15.8 each job) |
