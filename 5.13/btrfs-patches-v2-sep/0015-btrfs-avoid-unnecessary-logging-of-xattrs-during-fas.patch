Subject: [PATCH 15/18] btrfs: avoid unnecessary logging of xattrs during fast
 fsyncs

When logging an inode we always log all its xattrs, so that we are able
to figure out which ones should be deleted during log replay. However this
is unnecessary when we are doing a fast fsync and no xattrs were added,
changed or deleted since the last time we logged the inode in the current
transaction.

So skip the logging of xattrs when the inode was previously logged in the
current transaction and no xattrs were added, changed or deleted. If any
changes to xattrs happened, than the inode has BTRFS_INODE_COPY_EVERYTHING
set in its runtime flags and the xattrs get logged. This saves time on
scanning for xattrs, allocating memory, COWing log tree extent buffers and
adding more lock contention on the extent buffers when there are multiple
tasks logging in parallel.

The use of xattrs is common when using ACLs, some applications, or when
using security modules like SELinux where every inode gets a security
xattr added to it.

The following test script, using fio, was used on a box with 12 cores, 64G
of RAM, a NVMe device and the default non-debug kernel config from Debian.
It uses 8 concurrent jobs each writing in blocks of 64K to its own 4G file,
each file with a single xattr of 50 bytes (about the same size for an ACL
or SELinux xattr), doing random buffered writes with an fsync after each
write.

   $ cat test.sh
   #!/bin/bash

   DEV=/dev/nvme0n1
   MNT=/mnt/test
   MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o ssd"
   MKFS_OPTIONS="-d single -m single"

   NUM_JOBS=8
   FILE_SIZE=4G

   cat <<EOF > /tmp/fio-job.ini
   [writers]
   rw=randwrite
   fsync=1
   fallocate=none
   group_reporting=1
   direct=0
   bs=64K
   ioengine=sync
   size=$FILE_SIZE
   directory=$MNT
   numjobs=$NUM_JOBS
   EOF

   echo "performance" | \
       tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

   mkfs.btrfs -f $MKFS_OPTIONS $DEV > /dev/null
   mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

   echo "Creating files before fio runs, each with 1 xattr of 50 bytes"
   for ((i = 0; i < $NUM_JOBS; i++)); do
       path="$MNT/writers.$i.0"
       truncate -s $FILE_SIZE $path
       setfattr -n user.xa1 -v $(printf '%0.sX' $(seq 50)) $path
   done

   fio /tmp/fio-job.ini
   umount $MNT

fio output before this change:

WRITE: bw=120MiB/s (126MB/s), 120MiB/s-120MiB/s (126MB/s-126MB/s), io=32.0GiB (34.4GB), run=272145-272145msec

fio output after this change:

WRITE: bw=142MiB/s (149MB/s), 142MiB/s-142MiB/s (149MB/s-149MB/s), io=32.0GiB (34.4GB), run=230408-230408msec

+16.8% throughput, -16.6% runtime
