Subject: [PATCH 106/110] docs/cgroup-v1/blkio: update for 5.x kernels

Commit bf382fb0bcef4 ("block: remove legacy IO schedulers", Oct 12 2018)
removes the CFQ scheduler, together with blkio.weight and
blkio.weight_device described in cgroup v1 documentation. Users are
supposed to use the BFQ scheduler, which cgroup file for setting weight
is blkio.bfq.weight, but there is no way to set per-device weight.

Later, commit 795fe54c2a8 per-device weights for BFQ, meaning that
blkio.bfq.weight and blkio.bfq.weight_device can be used in a way
similar to the old CFQ cgroup interface.

Yet, the cgroup v1 docs were never updated. Fix this:
 - use the new file names;
 - fix the range for weight (used to be 10..1000, now 1..1000);
 - link to BFQ scheduler docs.
