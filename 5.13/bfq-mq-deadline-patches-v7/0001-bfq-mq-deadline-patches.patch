Subject: [PATCH 01/45] block, bfq: let also stably merged queues enjoy weight
 raising

Merged bfq_queues are kept out of weight-raising (low-latency)
mechanisms. The reason is that these queues are usually created for
non-interactive and non-soft-real-time tasks. Yet this is not the case
for stably-merged queues. These queues are merged just because they
are created shortly after each other. So they may easily serve the I/O
of an interactive or soft-real time application, if the application
happens to spawn multiple processes.

To address this issue, this commits lets also stably-merged queued
enjoy weight raising.

Subject: [PATCH 02/45] block, bfq: consider also creation time in delayed
 stable merge

Since commit 430a67f9d616 ("block, bfq: merge bursts of newly-created
queues"), BFQ may schedule a merge between a newly created sync
bfq_queue and the last sync bfq_queue created. Such a merging is not
performed immediately, because BFQ needs first to find out whether the
newly created queue actually reaches a higher throughput if not merged
at all (and in that case BFQ will not perform any stable merging). To
check that, a little time must be waited after the creation of the new
queue, so that some I/O can flow in the queue, and statistics on such
I/O can be computed.

Yet, to evaluate the above waiting time, the last split time is
considered as start time, instead of the creation time of the
queue. This is a mistake, because considering the split time is
correct only in the following scenario.

The queue undergoes a non-stable merges on the arrival of its very
first I/O request, due to close I/O with some other queue. While the
queue is merged for close I/O, stable merging is not considered. Yet
the queue may then happen to be split, if the close I/O finishes (or
happens to be a false positive). From this time on, the queue can
again be considered for stable merging. But, again, a little time must
elapse, to let some new I/O flow in the queue and to get updated
statistics. To wait for this time, the split time is to be taken into
account.

Yet, if the queue does not undergo a non-stable merge on the arrival
of its very first request, then BFQ immediately checks whether the
stable merge is to be performed. It happens because the split time for
a queue is initialized to minus infinity when the queue is created.

This commit fixes this mistake by adding the missing condition. Now
the check for delayed stable-merge is performed after a little time is
elapsed not only from the last queue split time, but also from the
creation time of the queue.

Subject: [PATCH 03/45] block, bfq: boost throughput by extending queue-merging
 times

One of the methods with which bfq boosts throughput is by merging queues.
One of the merging variants in bfq is the stable merge.
This mechanism is activated between two queues only if they are created
within a certain maximum time T1 from each other.
Merging can happen soon or be delayed. In the second case, before
merging, bfq needs to evaluate a throughput-boost parameter that
indicates whether the queue generates a high throughput is served alone.
Merging occurs when this throughput-boost is not high enough.
In particular, this parameter is evaluated and late merging may occur
only after at least a time T2 from the creation of the queue.

Currently T1 and T2 are set to 180ms and 200ms, respectively.
In this way the merging mechanism rarely occurs because time is not
enough. This results in a noticeable lowering of the overall throughput
with some workloads (see the example below).

This commit introduces two constants bfq_activation_stable_merging and
bfq_late_stable_merging in order to increase the duration of T1 and T2.
Both the stable merging activation time and the late merging
time are set to 600ms. This value has been experimentally evaluated
using sqlite benchmark in the Phoronix Test Suite on a HDD.
The duration of the benchmark before this fix was 111.02s, while now
it has reached 97.02s, a better result than that of all the other
schedulers.

Subject: [PATCH 04/45] block, bfq: check waker only for queues with no
 in-flight I/O

Consider two bfq_queues, say Q1 and Q2, with Q2 empty. If a request of
Q1 gets completed shortly before a new request arrives for Q2, then
BFQ flags Q1 as a candidate waker for Q2. Yet, the arrival of this new
request may have a different cause, in the following case. If also Q2
has requests in flight while waiting for the arrival of a new request,
then the completion of its own requests may be the actual cause of the
awakening of the process that sends I/O to Q2. So Q1 may be flagged
wrongly as a candidate waker.

This commit avoids this deceptive flagging, by disabling
candidate-waker flagging for Q2, if Q2 has in-flight I/O.

Subject: [PATCH 05/45] block: Do not pull requests from the scheduler when we
 cannot dispatch them

Provided the device driver does not implement dispatch budget accounting
(which only SCSI does) the loop in __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() pulls
requests from the IO scheduler as long as it is willing to give out any.
That defeats scheduling heuristics inside the scheduler by creating
false impression that the device can take more IO when it in fact
cannot.

For example with BFQ IO scheduler on top of virtio-blk device setting
blkio cgroup weight has barely any impact on observed throughput of
async IO because __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() always sucks out all the
IO queued in BFQ. BFQ first submits IO from higher weight cgroups but
when that is all dispatched, it will give out IO of lower weight cgroups
as well. And then we have to wait for all this IO to be dispatched to
the disk (which means lot of it actually has to complete) before the
IO scheduler is queried again for dispatching more requests. This
completely destroys any service differentiation.

So grab request tag for a request pulled out of the IO scheduler already
in __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() and do not pull any more requests if we
cannot get it because we are unlikely to be able to dispatch it. That
way only single request is going to wait in the dispatch list for some
tag to free.

Subject: [PATCH 06/45] block: Remove unnecessary elevator operation checks

The insert_requests and dispatch_request elevator operations are
mandatory for the correct execution of an elevator, and all implemented
elevators (bfq, kyber and mq-deadline) implement them. As a result,
there is no need to check for these operations before calling them when
a queue has an elevator set. This simplifies the code in
__blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests() and blk_mq_sched_insert_request().

To avoid out-of-tree elevators to crash the kernel in case of bad
implementation, add a check in elv_register() to verify that these
operations are implemented.

A small, probably not significant, IOPS improvement of 0.1% is observed
with this patch applied (4.117 MIOPS to 4.123 MIOPS, average of 20 fio
runs doing 4K random direct reads with psync and 32 jobs).

Subject: [PATCH 08/45] block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges

The function bfq_setup_merge prepares the merging between two
bfq_queues, say bfqq and new_bfqq. To this goal, it assigns
bfqq->new_bfqq = new_bfqq. Then, each time some I/O for bfqq arrives,
the process that generated that I/O is disassociated from bfqq and
associated with new_bfqq (merging is actually a redirection). In this
respect, bfq_setup_merge increases new_bfqq->ref in advance, adding
the number of processes that are expected to be associated with
new_bfqq.

Unfortunately, the stable-merging mechanism interferes with this
setup. After bfqq->new_bfqq has been set by bfq_setup_merge, and
before all the expected processes have been associated with
bfqq->new_bfqq, bfqq may happen to be stably merged with a different
queue than the current bfqq->new_bfqq. In this case, bfqq->new_bfqq
gets changed. So, some of the processes that have been already
accounted for in the ref counter of the previous new_bfqq will not be
associated with that queue.  This creates an unbalance, because those
references will never be decremented.

This commit fixes this issue by reestablishing the previous, natural
behaviour: once bfqq->new_bfqq has been set, it will not be changed
until all expected redirections have occurred.

Subject: [PATCH 09/45] block/Kconfig: Make the BLK_WBT and BLK_WBT_MQ entries
 consecutive

These entries were consecutive at the time of their introduction but are no
longer consecutive. Make these again consecutive. Additionally, modify the
help text since it refers to blk-mq and since the legacy block layer has
been removed.

Subject: [PATCH 12/45] block: Introduce the ioprio rq-qos policy

Introduce an rq-qos policy that assigns an I/O priority to requests based
on blk-cgroup configuration settings. This policy has the following
advantages over the ioprio_set() system call:
- This policy is cgroup based so it has all the advantages of cgroups.
- While ioprio_set() does not affect page cache writeback I/O, this rq-qos
  controller affects page cache writeback I/O for filesystems that support
  assiociating a cgroup with writeback I/O. See also
  Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst.

+IO Priority
+~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+A single attribute controls the behavior of the I/O priority cgroup policy,
+namely the blkio.prio.class attribute. The following values are accepted for
+that attribute:
+
+  no-change
+	Do not modify the I/O priority class.
+
+  none-to-rt
+	For requests that do not have an I/O priority class (NONE),
+	change the I/O priority class into RT. Do not modify
+	the I/O priority class of other requests.
+
+  restrict-to-be
+	For requests that do not have an I/O priority class or that have I/O
+	priority class RT, change it into BE. Do not modify the I/O priority
+	class of requests that have priority class IDLE.
+
+  idle
+	Change the I/O priority class of all requests into IDLE, the lowest
+	I/O priority class.
+
+The following numerical values are associated with the I/O priority policies:
+
++-------------+---+
+| no-change   | 0 |
++-------------+---+
+| none-to-rt  | 1 |
++-------------+---+
+| rt-to-be    | 2 |
++-------------+---+
+| all-to-idle | 3 |
++-------------+---+
+
+The numerical value that corresponds to each I/O priority class is as follows:
+
++-------------------------------+---+
+| IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE             | 0 |
++-------------------------------+---+
+| IOPRIO_CLASS_RT (real-time)   | 1 |
++-------------------------------+---+
+| IOPRIO_CLASS_BE (best effort) | 2 |
++-------------------------------+---+
+| IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE             | 3 |
++-------------------------------+---+
+
+The algorithm to set the I/O priority class for a request is as follows:
+
+- Translate the I/O priority class policy into a number.
+- Change the request I/O priority class into the maximum of the I/O priority
+  class policy number and the numerical I/O priority class.

Subject: [PATCH 17/45] block/mq-deadline: Improve compile-time argument
 checking

Modern compilers complain if an out-of-range value is passed to a function
argument that has an enumeration type. Let the compiler detect out-of-range
data direction arguments instead of verifying the data_dir argument at
runtime.

Subject: [PATCH 18/45] block/mq-deadline: Improve the sysfs show and store
 macros

Define separate macros for integers and jiffies to improve readability.
Use sysfs_emit() and kstrtoint() instead of sprintf() and simple_strtol().
The former functions are the recommended functions.

Subject: [PATCH 19/45] block/mq-deadline: Reserve 25% of scheduler tags for
 synchronous requests

For interactive workloads it is important that synchronous requests are
not delayed. Hence reserve 25% of scheduler tags for synchronous requests.
This patch still allows asynchronous requests to fill the hardware queues
since blk_mq_init_sched() makes sure that the number of scheduler requests
is the double of the hardware queue depth. From blk_mq_init_sched():

	q->nr_requests = 2 * min_t(unsigned int, q->tag_set->queue_depth,
				   BLKDEV_MAX_RQ);

Subject: [PATCH 20/45] block/mq-deadline: Micro-optimize the batching
 algorithm

When dispatching the first request of a batch, the deadline_move_request()
call clears .next_rq[] for the opposite data direction. .next_rq[] is not
restored when changing data direction. Fix this by not clearing .next_rq[]
and by keeping track of the data direction of a batch in a variable instead.

This patch is a micro-optimization because:
- The number of deadline_next_request() calls for the read direction is
  halved.
- The number of times that deadline_next_request() returns NULL is reduced.

Subject: [PATCH 23/45] block/mq-deadline: Add cgroup support

Maintain statistics per cgroup and export these to user space. These
statistics are essential for verifying whether the proper I/O priorities
have been assigned to requests. An example of the statistics data with
this patch applied:

$ cat /sys/fs/cgroup/io.stat
11:2 rbytes=0 wbytes=0 rios=3 wios=0 dbytes=0 dios=0 [NONE] dispatched=0 inserted=0 merged=171 [RT] dispatched=0 inserted=0 merged=0 [BE] dispatched=0 inserted=0 merged=0 [IDLE] dispatched=0 inserted=0 merged=0

Subject: [PATCH 24/45] block/mq-deadline: Prioritize high-priority requests

While one or more requests with a certain I/O priority are pending, do not
dispatch lower priority requests. Dispatch lower priority requests anyway
after the "aging" time has expired.

This patch has been tested as follows:

modprobe scsi_debug ndelay=1000000 max_queue=16 &&
sd='' &&
while [ -z "$sd" ]; do
  sd=/dev/$(basename /sys/bus/pseudo/drivers/scsi_debug/adapter*/host*/target*/*/block/*)
done &&
echo $((100*1000)) > /sys/block/$sd/queue/iosched/aging_expire &&
cd /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/ &&
echo $$ >cgroup.procs &&
echo restrict-to-be >blkio.prio.class &&
mkdir -p hipri &&
cd hipri &&
echo none-to-rt >blkio.prio.class &&
{ max-iops -a1 -d32 -j1 -e mq-deadline $sd >& ~/low-pri.txt & } &&
echo $$ >cgroup.procs &&
max-iops -a1 -d32 -j1 -e mq-deadline $sd >& ~/hi-pri.txt

Result:
* 11000 IOPS for the high-priority job
*    40 IOPS for the low-priority job

If the aging expiry time is changed from 100s into 0, the IOPS results change
into 6712 and 6796 IOPS.

The max-iops script is a script that runs fio with the following arguments:
--bs=4K --gtod_reduce=1 --ioengine=libaio --ioscheduler=${arg_e} --runtime=60
--norandommap --rw=read --thread --buffered=0 --numjobs=${arg_j}
--iodepth=${arg_d} --iodepth_batch_submit=${arg_a}
--iodepth_batch_complete=$((arg_d / 2)) --name=${positional_argument_1}
--filename=${positional_argument_1}

Subject: [PATCH 25/45] block/mq-deadline: Remove a WARN_ON_ONCE() call

The purpose of the WARN_ON_ONCE() statement in dd_insert_request() is to
verify that dd_prepare_request() cleared rq->elv.priv[0]. Since
dd_prepare_request() is called during request initialization but not if a
request is requeued, a warning is triggered if a request is requeued. Fix
this by removing the WARN_ON_ONCE() statement. This patch suppresses the
following kernel warning:

Subject: [PATCH 26/45] block: increase BLKCG_MAX_POLS

After mq-deadline learnt to deal with cgroups, the BLKCG_MAX_POLS value
became too small for all the elevators to be registered properly. The
following issue is seen:

```
calling  bfq_init+0x0/0x8b @ 1
blkcg_policy_register: BLKCG_MAX_POLS too small
initcall bfq_init+0x0/0x8b returned -28 after 507 usecs
```

and BFQ is non-functional.

Increase BLKCG_MAX_POLS to allow space for everyone

Subject: [PATCH 28/45] bfq: Remove merged request already in
 bfq_requests_merged()

Currently, bfq does very little in bfq_requests_merged() and handles all
the request cleanup in bfq_finish_requeue_request() called from
blk_mq_free_request(). That is currently safe only because
blk_mq_free_request() is called shortly after bfq_requests_merged()
while bfqd->lock is still held. However to fix a lock inversion between
bfqd->lock and ioc->lock, we need to call blk_mq_free_request() after
dropping bfqd->lock. That would mean that already merged request could
be seen by other processes inside bfq queues and possibly dispatched to
the device which is wrong. So move cleanup of the request from
bfq_finish_requeue_request() to bfq_requests_merged().

Subject: [PATCH 29/45] blk: Fix lock inversion between ioc lock and bfqd lock

Lockdep complains about lock inversion between ioc->lock and bfqd->lock:

bfqd -> ioc:
 put_io_context+0x33/0x90 -> ioc->lock grabbed
 blk_mq_free_request+0x51/0x140
 blk_put_request+0xe/0x10
 blk_attempt_req_merge+0x1d/0x30
 elv_attempt_insert_merge+0x56/0xa0
 blk_mq_sched_try_insert_merge+0x4b/0x60
 bfq_insert_requests+0x9e/0x18c0 -> bfqd->lock grabbed
 blk_mq_sched_insert_requests+0xd6/0x2b0
 blk_mq_flush_plug_list+0x154/0x280
 blk_finish_plug+0x40/0x60
 ext4_writepages+0x696/0x1320
 do_writepages+0x1c/0x80
 __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0xd7/0x120
 sync_file_range+0xac/0xf0

ioc->bfqd:
 bfq_exit_icq+0xa3/0xe0 -> bfqd->lock grabbed
 put_io_context_active+0x78/0xb0 -> ioc->lock grabbed
 exit_io_context+0x48/0x50
 do_exit+0x7e9/0xdd0
 do_group_exit+0x54/0xc0

To avoid this inversion we change blk_mq_sched_try_insert_merge() to not
free the merged request but rather leave that upto the caller similarly
to blk_mq_sched_try_merge(). And in bfq_insert_requests() we make sure
to free all the merged requests after dropping bfqd->lock.

Subject: [PATCH 30/45] block: return ELEVATOR_DISCARD_MERGE if possible

When merging one bio to request, if they are discard IO and the queue
supports multi-range discard, we need to return ELEVATOR_DISCARD_MERGE
because both block core and related drivers(nvme, virtio-blk) can't
handle mixed discard io merge(traditional IO merge together with
discard merge) well.

Fix the issue by trying to return ELEVATOR_DISCARD_MERGE first in this
situation, so both blk-mq and drivers just need to handle multi-range discard.

In theory, the fixes should be 1e739730c5b9 ("block: optionally merge
discontiguous discard bios into a single request"). The reason why it
isn't be triggered before 2705dfb20947 ("block: fix discard request merge")
is that the nr_segment of each bio is exactly 1 for multi-range device.

Fixes: 2705dfb20947 ("block: fix discard request merge")

Subject: [PATCH 33/45] Revert "block/mq-deadline: Add cgroup support"

This reverts commit 08a9ad8bf607 ("block/mq-deadline: Add cgroup support")
and a follow-up commit c06bc5a3fb42 ("block/mq-deadline: Remove a
WARN_ON_ONCE() call"). The added cgroup support has the following issues:

* It breaks cgroup interface file format rule by adding custom elements to a
  nested key-value file.

* It registers mq-deadline as a cgroup-aware policy even though all it's
  doing is collecting per-cgroup stats. Even if we need these stats, this
  isn't the right way to add them.

* It hasn't been reviewed from cgroup side.

Subject: [PATCH 35/45] block: return ELEVATOR_DISCARD_MERGE if possible

When merging one bio to request, if they are discard IO and the queue
supports multi-range discard, we need to return ELEVATOR_DISCARD_MERGE
because both block core and related drivers(nvme, virtio-blk) can't
handle mixed discard io merge(traditional IO merge together with
discard merge) well.

Fix the issue by trying to return ELEVATOR_DISCARD_MERGE first in this
situation, so both blk-mq and drivers just need to handle multi-range discard.

In theory, the fixes should be 1e739730c5b9 ("block: optionally merge
discontiguous discard bios into a single request"). The reason why it
isn't be triggered before 2705dfb20947 ("block: fix discard request merge")
is that the nr_segment of each bio is exactly 1 for multi-range device.

Fixes: 2705dfb20947 ("block: fix discard request merge")

The block layer may call the I/O scheduler .finish_request() callback
without having called the .insert_requests() callback. Make sure that the
mq-deadline I/O statistics are correct if the block layer inserts an I/O
request that bypasses the I/O scheduler. This patch prevents that lower
priority I/O is delayed longer than necessary for mixed I/O priority
workloads.

Subject: [PATCH 41/45] block/mq-deadline: Speed up the dispatch of
 low-priority requests

dd_queued() traverses the percpu variable for summation. The more cores,
the higher the performance overhead. I currently have a 128-core board and
this function takes 2.5 us. If the number of high-priority requests is
small and the number of low- and medium-priority requests is large, the
performance impact is significant.

Let's maintain a non-percpu member variable 'nr_queued', which is
incremented by 1 immediately following "inserted++" and decremented by 1
immediately following "completed++". Because both the judgment dd_queued()
in dd_dispatch_request() and operation "inserted++" in dd_insert_request()
are protected by dd->lock, lock protection needs to be added only in
dd_finish_request(), which is unlikely to cause significant performance
side effects.

Tested on my 128-core board with two ssd disks.

Subject: [PATCH 43/45] block/mq-deadline: Fix request accounting

Handle the following two cases correctly:
- I/O scheduler bypass. If the I/O scheduler is bypassed, .finish_request()
  is called but .insert_requests() not.
- Requeueing. If an I/O request is requeued then .insert_requests() is
  called multiple times for the same requests.
Make sure that the mq-deadline I/O statistics are correct in both cases.
This patch prevents that lower priority I/O is delayed longer than
necessary for mixed I/O priority workloads.

Subject: [PATCH 45/45] block/mq-deadline: Restore performance

A performance test on my test setup with kernel v5.11 and the mq-deadline
scheduler shows about 1100 M IOPS. This patch increases performance from
760 K IOPS to 1090 K IOPS.

Fixes: fb926032b320 ("block/mq-deadline: Prioritize high-priority requests")
