Subject: [PATCH 02/44] block, bfq: let also stably merged queues enjoy weight
 raising

Merged bfq_queues are kept out of weight-raising (low-latency)
mechanisms. The reason is that these queues are usually created for
non-interactive and non-soft-real-time tasks. Yet this is not the case
for stably-merged queues. These queues are merged just because they
are created shortly after each other. So they may easily serve the I/O
of an interactive or soft-real time application, if the application
happens to spawn multiple processes.

To address this issue, this commits lets also stably-merged queued
enjoy weight raising.

Subject: [PATCH 03/44] block, bfq: consider also creation time in delayed
 stable merge

Since commit 430a67f9d616 ("block, bfq: merge bursts of newly-created
queues"), BFQ may schedule a merge between a newly created sync
bfq_queue and the last sync bfq_queue created. Such a merging is not
performed immediately, because BFQ needs first to find out whether the
newly created queue actually reaches a higher throughput if not merged
at all (and in that case BFQ will not perform any stable merging). To
check that, a little time must be waited after the creation of the new
queue, so that some I/O can flow in the queue, and statistics on such
I/O can be computed.

Yet, to evaluate the above waiting time, the last split time is
considered as start time, instead of the creation time of the
queue. This is a mistake, because considering the split time is
correct only in the following scenario.

The queue undergoes a non-stable merges on the arrival of its very
first I/O request, due to close I/O with some other queue. While the
queue is merged for close I/O, stable merging is not considered. Yet
the queue may then happen to be split, if the close I/O finishes (or
happens to be a false positive). From this time on, the queue can
again be considered for stable merging. But, again, a little time must
elapse, to let some new I/O flow in the queue and to get updated
statistics. To wait for this time, the split time is to be taken into
account.

Yet, if the queue does not undergo a non-stable merge on the arrival
of its very first request, then BFQ immediately checks whether the
stable merge is to be performed. It happens because the split time for
a queue is initialized to minus infinity when the queue is created.

This commit fixes this mistake by adding the missing condition. Now
the check for delayed stable-merge is performed after a little time is
elapsed not only from the last queue split time, but also from the
creation time of the queue.

Subject: [PATCH 04/44] block, bfq: boost throughput by extending queue-merging
 times

One of the methods with which bfq boosts throughput is by merging queues.
One of the merging variants in bfq is the stable merge.
This mechanism is activated between two queues only if they are created
within a certain maximum time T1 from each other.
Merging can happen soon or be delayed. In the second case, before
merging, bfq needs to evaluate a throughput-boost parameter that
indicates whether the queue generates a high throughput is served alone.
Merging occurs when this throughput-boost is not high enough.
In particular, this parameter is evaluated and late merging may occur
only after at least a time T2 from the creation of the queue.

Currently T1 and T2 are set to 180ms and 200ms, respectively.
In this way the merging mechanism rarely occurs because time is not
enough. This results in a noticeable lowering of the overall throughput
with some workloads (see the example below).

This commit introduces two constants bfq_activation_stable_merging and
bfq_late_stable_merging in order to increase the duration of T1 and T2.
Both the stable merging activation time and the late merging
time are set to 600ms. This value has been experimentally evaluated
using sqlite benchmark in the Phoronix Test Suite on a HDD.
The duration of the benchmark before this fix was 111.02s, while now
it has reached 97.02s, a better result than that of all the other
schedulers.

Subject: [PATCH 05/44] block, bfq: check waker only for queues with no
 in-flight I/O

Consider two bfq_queues, say Q1 and Q2, with Q2 empty. If a request of
Q1 gets completed shortly before a new request arrives for Q2, then
BFQ flags Q1 as a candidate waker for Q2. Yet, the arrival of this new
request may have a different cause, in the following case. If also Q2
has requests in flight while waiting for the arrival of a new request,
then the completion of its own requests may be the actual cause of the
awakening of the process that sends I/O to Q2. So Q1 may be flagged
wrongly as a candidate waker.

This commit avoids this deceptive flagging, by disabling
candidate-waker flagging for Q2, if Q2 has in-flight I/O.

Subject: [PATCH 06/44] block: Do not pull requests from the scheduler when we
 cannot dispatch them

Provided the device driver does not implement dispatch budget accounting
(which only SCSI does) the loop in __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() pulls
requests from the IO scheduler as long as it is willing to give out any.
That defeats scheduling heuristics inside the scheduler by creating
false impression that the device can take more IO when it in fact
cannot.

For example with BFQ IO scheduler on top of virtio-blk device setting
blkio cgroup weight has barely any impact on observed throughput of
async IO because __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() always sucks out all the
IO queued in BFQ. BFQ first submits IO from higher weight cgroups but
when that is all dispatched, it will give out IO of lower weight cgroups
as well. And then we have to wait for all this IO to be dispatched to
the disk (which means lot of it actually has to complete) before the
IO scheduler is queried again for dispatching more requests. This
completely destroys any service differentiation.

So grab request tag for a request pulled out of the IO scheduler already
in __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() and do not pull any more requests if we
cannot get it because we are unlikely to be able to dispatch it. That
way only single request is going to wait in the dispatch list for some
tag to free.

Subject: [PATCH 07/44] block: Remove unnecessary elevator operation checks

The insert_requests and dispatch_request elevator operations are
mandatory for the correct execution of an elevator, and all implemented
elevators (bfq, kyber and mq-deadline) implement them. As a result,
there is no need to check for these operations before calling them when
a queue has an elevator set. This simplifies the code in
__blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests() and blk_mq_sched_insert_request().

To avoid out-of-tree elevators to crash the kernel in case of bad
implementation, add a check in elv_register() to verify that these
operations are implemented.

A small, probably not significant, IOPS improvement of 0.1% is observed
with this patch applied (4.117 MIOPS to 4.123 MIOPS, average of 20 fio
runs doing 4K random direct reads with psync and 32 jobs).

Subject: [PATCH 08/44] bfq: Remove merged request already in
 bfq_requests_merged()

Currently, bfq does very little in bfq_requests_merged() and handles all
the request cleanup in bfq_finish_requeue_request() called from
blk_mq_free_request(). That is currently safe only because
blk_mq_free_request() is called shortly after bfq_requests_merged()
while bfqd->lock is still held. However to fix a lock inversion between
bfqd->lock and ioc->lock, we need to call blk_mq_free_request() after
dropping bfqd->lock. That would mean that already merged request could
be seen by other processes inside bfq queues and possibly dispatched to
the device which is wrong. So move cleanup of the request from
bfq_finish_requeue_request() to bfq_requests_merged().

Subject: [PATCH 09/44] blk: Fix lock inversion between ioc lock and bfqd lock

Lockdep complains about lock inversion between ioc->lock and bfqd->lock:

bfqd -> ioc:
 put_io_context+0x33/0x90 -> ioc->lock grabbed
 blk_mq_free_request+0x51/0x140
 blk_put_request+0xe/0x10
 blk_attempt_req_merge+0x1d/0x30
 elv_attempt_insert_merge+0x56/0xa0
 blk_mq_sched_try_insert_merge+0x4b/0x60
 bfq_insert_requests+0x9e/0x18c0 -> bfqd->lock grabbed
 blk_mq_sched_insert_requests+0xd6/0x2b0
 blk_mq_flush_plug_list+0x154/0x280
 blk_finish_plug+0x40/0x60
 ext4_writepages+0x696/0x1320
 do_writepages+0x1c/0x80
 __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0xd7/0x120
 sync_file_range+0xac/0xf0

ioc->bfqd:
 bfq_exit_icq+0xa3/0xe0 -> bfqd->lock grabbed
 put_io_context_active+0x78/0xb0 -> ioc->lock grabbed
 exit_io_context+0x48/0x50
 do_exit+0x7e9/0xdd0
 do_group_exit+0x54/0xc0

To avoid this inversion we change blk_mq_sched_try_insert_merge() to not
free the merged request but rather leave that upto the caller similarly
to blk_mq_sched_try_merge(). And in bfq_insert_requests() we make sure
to free all the merged requests after dropping bfqd->lock.

Subject: [PATCH 11/44] bfq: convert the type of bfq_group.bfqd to bfq_data*

Setting bfq_group.bfqd to void* type does not seem to make much sense.
This will cause unnecessary type conversion. Perhaps it would be better
to change it to bfq_data* type.

Subject: [PATCH 12/44] bfq: limit the IO depth of CLASS_IDLE to 1

The IO depth of queues belong to CLASS_IDLE is limited to 1,
so that it can avoid introducing a larger tail latency under
a device with a larger IO depth. Although limiting the IO
depth may reduce the performance of idle_class, it is
generally not a big problem, because idle_class usually does
not have strict performance requirements.

Subject: [PATCH 13/44] bfq: keep the minimun bandwidth for CLASS_BE

CLASS_RT will preempt other classes, which may starve. At
present, CLASS_IDLE has alleviated the starvation problem
through the minimum bandwidth mechanism. Similarly, we
should do the same for CLASS_BE.

Since we will initialize sched_data.service_tree[] in
bfq_init_root_group(), bfq_create_group_hierarchy() can
ignore this part of the initialization, which can avoid
repeated initialization.

Since weight, ioprio, ioprio_class will be updated in bfq_init_entity(),
st->wsum will be updated in __bfq_activate_entity(), so when it is first
active, it seems that __bfq_entity_update_weight_prio() has nothing to
do. By resetting entity->prio_change in bfq_init_entity(), we can avoid
unnecessary logic calls.

Subject: [PATCH 21/44] block: Provide icq in request allocation data

Currently we lookup ICQ only after the request is allocated. However BFQ
will want to decide how many scheduler tags it allows a given bfq queue
(effectively a process) to consume based on cgroup weight. So lookup ICQ
earlier and provide it in struct blk_mq_alloc_data so that BFQ can use
it.

Subject: [PATCH 22/44] bfq: Track number of allocated requests in bfq_entity

When we want to limit number of requests used by each bfqq and also
cgroup, we need to track also number of requests used by each cgroup.
So track number of allocated requests for each bfq_entity.

Subject: [PATCH 23/44] bfq: Limit number of requests consumed by each cgroup

When cgroup IO scheduling is used with BFQ it does not really provide
service differentiation if the cgroup drives a big IO depth. That for
example happens with writeback which asynchronously submits lots of IO
but it can happen with AIO as well. The problem is that if we have two
cgroups that submit IO with different weights, the cgroup with higher
weight properly gets more IO time and is able to dispatch more IO.
However this causes lower weight cgroup to accumulate more requests
inside BFQ and eventually lower weight cgroup consumes most of IO
scheduler tags. At that point higher weight cgroup stops getting better
service as it is mostly blocked waiting for a scheduler tag while its
queues inside BFQ are empty and thus lower weight cgroup gets served.

Check how many requests submitting cgroup has allocated in
bfq_limit_depth() and if it consumes more requests than what would
correspond to its weight limit available depth to 1 so that the cgroup
cannot consume many more requests. With this limitation the higher
weight cgroup gets proper service even with writeback.

Subject: [PATCH 24/44] block, bfq: do not idle if only one cgroup is activated

If only one group is activated, specifically
'bfqd->num_groups_with_pending_reqs == 1', there is no need to guarantee
the same share of the throughput of queues in the same group.

Thus change the condition from '> 0' to '> 1' in
bfq_asymmetric_scenario(). By the way, if 'num_groups_with_pending_reqs'
is greater than 1, there is no need to check 'varied_queue_weights' and
'multiple_classes_busy', thus move the judgement forward.

Test procedure:
run "fio -numjobs=1 -ioengine=psync -bs=4k -direct=1 -rw=randread..." multiple
times in the same cgroup(not root).

Test result: total bandwidth(Mib/s)

By the way, if I test with "fio -numjobs=1/2/4/8 ...", test result is
the same with or without this patch.

If bfq keep dispatching requests with same size, the following

1) the size
2) the count of requests
3) when the first request was dispatched

These will be used in later patch to support concurrent sync

Subject: [PATCH 26/44] block, bfq: consider request size in
 bfq_asymmetric_scenario()

There is a special case when bfq do not need to idle when more than
one groups is active:

 1) all active queues have the same weight,
 2) all active queues have the same request size.
 3) all active queues belong to the same I/O-priority class,

Each time a request is dispatched, bfq can switch in service queue
safely, since the throughput of each active queue is guaranteed to
be equivalent.

Test procedure:
run "fio -numjobs=1 -ioengine=psync -bs=4k -direct=1 -rw=randread..." in
different cgroup(not root).

Subject: [PATCH 27/44] block,bfq: fix the timeout calculation in
 bfq_bfqq_charge_time

in bfq_bfqq_charge_time, timeout_ms is calculated with global
constant bfq_timeout(HZ/8), which is not correct. It should be
bfqd->bfq_timeout here as per-device bfq_timeout can be modified
through /sys/block/<disk/queue/iosched/timeout_sync.

Subject: [PATCH 31/44] block: Provide icq in request allocation data

Currently we lookup ICQ only after the request is allocated. However BFQ
will want to decide how many scheduler tags it allows a given bfq queue
(effectively a process) to consume based on cgroup weight. So lookup ICQ
earlier and provide it in struct blk_mq_alloc_data so that BFQ can use
it.

When we want to limit number of requests used by each bfqq and also
cgroup, we need to track also number of requests used by each cgroup.
So track number of allocated requests for each bfq_entity.

Subject: [PATCH 33/44] bfq: Limit number of requests consumed by each cgroup

When cgroup IO scheduling is used with BFQ it does not really provide
service differentiation if the cgroup drives a big IO depth. That for
example happens with writeback which asynchronously submits lots of IO
but it can happen with AIO as well. The problem is that if we have two
cgroups that submit IO with different weights, the cgroup with higher
weight properly gets more IO time and is able to dispatch more IO.
However this causes lower weight cgroup to accumulate more requests
inside BFQ and eventually lower weight cgroup consumes most of IO
scheduler tags. At that point higher weight cgroup stops getting better
service as it is mostly blocked waiting for a scheduler tag while its
queues inside BFQ are empty and thus lower weight cgroup gets served.

Check how many requests submitting cgroup has allocated in
bfq_limit_depth() and if it consumes more requests than what would
correspond to its weight limit available depth to 1 so that the cgroup
cannot consume many more requests. With this limitation the higher
weight cgroup gets proper service even with writeback.

according to the subtraction operation here,now_ns is ns,

Subject: [PATCH 37/44] block: return ELEVATOR_DISCARD_MERGE if possible

When merging one bio to request, if they are discard IO and the queue
supports multi-range discard, we need to return ELEVATOR_DISCARD_MERGE
because both block core and related drivers(nvme, virtio-blk) doesn't
handle mixed discard io merge(traditional IO merge together with
discard merge) well.

Fix the issue by returning ELEVATOR_DISCARD_MERGE in this situation,
so both blk-mq and drivers just need to handle multi-range discard.

Subject: [PATCH 39/44] ioprio: move user space relevant ioprio bits to UAPI
 includes

systemd added a modified copy of include/linux/ioprio.h into its
code to get the relevant content definitions for the exposed
ioprio_[get|set] system calls.

Move the user space relevant ioprio bits to the UAPI includes to be
able to use the ioprio_[get|set] syscalls as intended.

Subject: [PATCH 40/44] block: bfq: fix bfq_set_next_ioprio_data()

For a request that has a priority level equal to or larger than
IOPRIO_BE_NR, bfq_set_next_ioprio_data() prints a critical warning but
defaults to setting the request new_ioprio field to IOPRIO_BE_NR. This
is not consistent with the warning and the allowed values for priority
levels. Fix this by setting the request new_ioprio field to
IOPRIO_BE_NR - 1, the lowest priority level allowed.

Subject: [PATCH 41/44] block: fix ioprio interface

An iocb aio_reqprio field is 16 bits only, but often handled as an int
in the block layer. E.g. ioprio_check_cap() takes an int as argument.
However, with such int casting function calls, the upper 16 bits of the
argument may be left uninitialized by the compiler, resulting in
invalid values for the IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS() macro (garbage upper bits)
and in an error return for functions such as ioprio_check_cap().

Fix this by masking the result of the shift by IOPRIO_CLASS_SHIFT bits
in the IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS() macro. The new macro IOPRIO_CLASS_MASK
defines the 3-bits mask for the priority class.

While at it, cleanup the following:
* Update the mention of CFQ in the comment describing priority classes
  and mention BFQ and mq-deadline.
* Change the argument name of the IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS() and
  IOPRIO_PRIO_DATA() macros from "mask" to "val" to reflect the fact
  that an IO priority value should be passed rather than a mask.
* Change the ioprio_valid() macro into an inline function, adding a
  check on the maximum value of the class of a priority as defined by
  the IOPRIO_CLASS_MAX enum value.
* Remove the unnecessary "else" after the return statements in
  task_nice_ioclass().

Subject: [PATCH 42/44] block: rename IOPRIO_BE_NR

The BFQ scheduler and ioprio_check_cap() both assume that the RT
priority class (IOPRIO_CLASS_RT) can have up to 8 different priority
levels. This is controlled using the macro IOPRIO_BE_NR, which is badly
named as the number of levels applies to the RT class too.

Rename IOPRIO_BE_NR to IOPRIO_NR_LEVELS to make things clear.

Subject: [PATCH 43/44] bfq: optimize the calculation of bfq_weight_to_ioprio()

The value range of ioprio is [0, 7], but the result of
bfq_weight_to_ioprio() may exceed this range, so simple
optimization is required.

Subject: [PATCH 44/44] block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges

The function bfq_setup_merge prepares the merging between two
bfq_queues, say bfqq and new_bfqq. To this goal, it assigns
bfqq->new_bfqq = new_bfqq. Then, each time some I/O for bfqq arrives,
the process that generated that I/O is disassociated from bfqq and
associated with new_bfqq (merging is actually a redirection). In this
respect, bfq_setup_merge increases new_bfqq->ref in advance, adding
the number of processes that are expected to be associated with
new_bfqq.

Unfortunately, the stable-merging mechanism interferes with this
setup. After bfqq->new_bfqq has been set by bfq_setup_merge, and
before all the expected processes have been associated with
bfqq->new_bfqq, bfqq may happen to be stably merged with a different
queue than the current bfqq->new_bfqq. In this case, bfqq->new_bfqq
gets changed. So, some of the processes that have been already
accounted for in the ref counter of the previous new_bfqq will not be
associated with that queue.  This creates an unbalance, because those
references will never be decremented.

This commit fixes this issue by reestablishing the previous, natural
behaviour: once bfqq->new_bfqq has been set, it will not be changed
until all expected redirections have occurred.
