Subject: [PATCH 16/18] xfs: journal IO cache flush reductions

Currently every journal IO is issued as REQ_PREFLUSH | REQ_FUA to
guarantee the ordering requirements the journal has w.r.t. metadata
writeback. THe two ordering constraints are:

1. we cannot overwrite metadata in the journal until we guarantee
that the dirty metadata has been written back in place and is
stable.

2. we cannot write back dirty metadata until it has been written to
the journal and guaranteed to be stable (and hence recoverable) in
the journal.

THe ordering guarantees of #1 are provided by REQ_PREFLUSH. This
causes the journal IO to issue a cache flush and wait for it to
complete before issuing the write IO to the journal. Hence all
completed metadata IO is guaranteed to be stable before the journal
overwrites the old metadata.

THe ordering guarantees of #2 are provided by the REQ_FUA, which
ensures the journal writes do not complete until they are on stable
storage. Hence by the time the last journal IO in a checkpoint
completes, we know that the entire checkpoint is on stable storage
and we can unpin the dirty metadata and allow it to be written back.

This is the mechanism by which ordering was first implemented in XFS
way back in 2002 by this commit:

    Add support for drive write cache flushing - should the kernel
    have the infrastructure

A lot has changed since then, most notably we now use delayed
logging to checkpoint the filesystem to the journal rather than
write each individual transaction to the journal. Cache flushes on
journal IO are necessary when individual transactions are wholly
contained within a single iclog. However, CIL checkpoints are single
transactions that typically span hundreds to thousands of individual
journal writes, and so the requirements for device cache flushing
have changed.

That is, the ordering rules I state above apply to ordering of
atomic transactions recorded in the journal, not to the journal IO
itself. Hence we need to ensure metadata is stable before we start
writing a new transaction to the journal (guarantee #1), and we need
to ensure the entire transaction is stable in the journal before we
start metadata writeback (guarantee #2).

Hence we only need a REQ_PREFLUSH on the journal IO that starts a
new journal transaction to provide #1, and it is not on any other
journal IO done within the context of that journal transaction.

To ensure that the entire journal transaction is on stable storage
before we run the completion code that unpins all the dirty metadata
recorded in the journal transaction, the last write of the
transaction must also ensure that the entire journal transaction is
stable. We already know what IO that will be, thanks to the commit
record we explicitly write to complete the transaction. We can order
all the previous journal IO for this transaction by waiting for all
the previous iclogs containing the transaction data to complete
their IO, then issuing the commit record IO using REQ_PREFLUSH
| REQ_FUA. The preflush ensures all the previous journal IO is
stable before the commit record hits the log, and the REQ_FUA
ensures that the commit record is stable before completion is
signalled to the filesystem.

Hence using REQ_PREFLUSH on the first IO of a journal transaction,
and then ordering the journal IO before issuing the commit record
with REQ_PREFLUSH | REQ_FUA, we get all the same ordering guarantees
that we currently achieve by issuing all journal IO with cache
flushes.

As an optimisation, when the commit record lands in the same iclog
as the journal transaction starts, we don't need to wait for
anything and can simply issue the journal IO with REQ_PREFLUSH |
REQ_FUA as we do right now. This means that for fsync() heavy
workloads, the cache flush behaviour is completely unchanged and
there is no degradation in performance as a result of optimise the
multi-IO transaction case.

To further simplify the implementation, we also issue the initial IO
in a journal transaction with REQ_FUA. THis ensures the journal is
dirtied by the first IO in a long running transaction as quickly as
possible. This helps ensure that log recovery will at least have a
transaction header for the incomplete transaction in the log similar
to the stable journal write behaviour we have now.

The most notable sign that there is less IO latency on my test
machine (nvme SSDs) is that the "noiclogs" rate has dropped
substantially. This metric indicates that the CIL push is blocking
in xlog_get_iclog_space() waiting for iclog IO completion to occur.
With 8 iclogs of 256kB, the rate is appoximately 1 noiclog event to
every 4 iclog writes. IOWs, every 4th call to xlog_get_iclog_space()
is blocking waiting for log IO. With the changes in this patch, this
drops to 1 noiclog event for every 100 iclog writes. Hence it is
clear that log IO is completing much faster than it was previously,
but it is also clear that for large iclog sizes, this isn't the
performance limiting factor on this hardware.

With smaller iclogs (32kB), however, there is a sustantial
difference. With the cache flush modifications, the journal is now
running at over 4000 write IOPS, and the journal throughput is
largely identical to the 256kB iclogs and the noiclog event rate
stays low at about 1:50 iclog writes. The existing code tops out at
about 2500 IOPS as the number of cache flushes dominate performance
and latency. The noiclog event rate is about 1:4, and the
performance variance is quite large as the journal throughput can
fall to less than half the peak sustained rate when the cache flush
rate prevents metadata writeback from keeping up and the log runs
out of space and throttles reservations.

As a result:

	logbsize	fsmark create rate	rm -rf
before	32kb		152851+/-5.3e+04	5m28s
patched	32kb		221533+/-1.1e+04	5m24s

before	256kb		220239+/-6.2e+03	4m58s
patched	256kb		228286+/-9.2e+03	5m06s

The rm -rf times are included because I ran them, but the
differences are largely noise. This workload is largely metadata
read IO latency bound and the changes to the journal cache flushing
doesn't really make any noticable difference to behaviour apart from
a reduction in noiclog events from background CIL pushing.
