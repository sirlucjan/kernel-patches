Subject: [PATCH 19/63] block/Kconfig: Make the BLK_WBT and BLK_WBT_MQ entries
 consecutive

These entries were consecutive at the time of their introduction but are no
longer consecutive. Make these again consecutive. Additionally, modify the
help text since it refers to blk-mq and since the legacy block layer has
been removed.
