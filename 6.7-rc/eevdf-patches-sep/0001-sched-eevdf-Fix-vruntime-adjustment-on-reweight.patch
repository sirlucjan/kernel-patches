Subject: [PATCH 01/10] sched/eevdf: Fix vruntime adjustment on reweight

vruntime of the (on_rq && !0-lag) entity needs to be adjusted when
it gets re-weighted, and the calculations can be simplified based
on the fact that re-weight won't change the w-average of all the
entities. Please check the proofs in comments.

But adjusting vruntime can also cause position change in RB-tree
hence require re-queue to fix up which might be costly. This might
be avoided by deferring adjustment to the time the entity actually
leaves tree (dequeue/pick), but that will negatively affect task
selection and probably not good enough either.

+	 * VRUNTIME
+	 * ========
+	 *
+	 * COROLLARY #1: The virtual runtime of the entity needs to be
+	 * adjusted if re-weight at !0-lag point.
+	 *
+	 * Proof: For contradiction assume this is not true, so we can
+	 * re-weight without changing vruntime at !0-lag point.
+	 *
+	 *             Weight	VRuntime   Avg-VRuntime
+	 *     before    w          v            V
+	 *      after    w'         v'           V'
+	 *
+	 * Since lag needs to be preserved through re-weight:
+	 *
+	 *	lag = (V - v)*w = (V'- v')*w', where v = v'
+	 *	==>	V' = (V - v)*w/w' + v		(1)
+	 *
+	 * Let W be the total weight of the entities before reweight,
+	 * since V' is the new weighted average of entities:
+	 *
+	 *	V' = (WV + w'v - wv) / (W + w' - w)	(2)
+	 *
+	 * by using (1) & (2) we obtain:
+	 *
+	 *	(WV + w'v - wv) / (W + w' - w) = (V - v)*w/w' + v
+	 *	==> (WV-Wv+Wv+w'v-wv)/(W+w'-w) = (V - v)*w/w' + v
+	 *	==> (WV - Wv)/(W + w' - w) + v = (V - v)*w/w' + v
+	 *	==>	(V - v)*W/(W + w' - w) = (V - v)*w/w' (3)
+	 *
+	 * Since we are doing at !0-lag point which means V != v, we
+	 * can simplify (3):
+	 *
+	 *	==>	W / (W + w' - w) = w / w'
+	 *	==>	Ww' = Ww + ww' - ww
+	 *	==>	W * (w' - w) = w * (w' - w)
+	 *	==>	W = w	(re-weight indicates w' != w)
+	 *
+	 * So the cfs_rq contains only one entity, hence vruntime of
+	 * the entity @v should always equal to the cfs_rq's weighted
+	 * average vruntime @V, which means we will always re-weight
+	 * at 0-lag point, thus breach assumption. Proof completed.
+	 *
+	 *
+	 * COROLLARY #2: Re-weight does NOT affect weighted average
+	 * vruntime of all the entities.
+	 *
+	 * Proof: According to corollary #1, Eq. (1) should be:
+	 *
+	 *	(V - v)*w = (V' - v')*w'
+	 *	==>    v' = V' - (V - v)*w/w'		(4)
+	 *
+	 * According to the weighted average formula, we have:
+	 *
+	 *	V' = (WV - wv + w'v') / (W - w + w')
+	 *	   = (WV - wv + w'(V' - (V - v)w/w')) / (W - w + w')
+	 *	   = (WV - wv + w'V' - Vw + wv) / (W - w + w')
+	 *	   = (WV + w'V' - Vw) / (W - w + w')
+	 *
+	 *	==>  V'*(W - w + w') = WV + w'V' - Vw
+	 *	==>	V' * (W - w) = (W - w) * V	(5)
+	 *
+	 * If the entity is the only one in the cfs_rq, then reweight
+	 * always occurs at 0-lag point, so V won't change. Or else
+	 * there are other entities, hence W != w, then Eq. (5) turns
+	 * into V' = V. So V won't change in either case, proof done.
+	 *
+	 *
+	 * So according to corollary #1 & #2, the effect of re-weight
+	 * on vruntime should be:
+	 *
+	 *	v' = V' - (V - v) * w / w'		(4)
+	 *	   = V  - (V - v) * w / w'
+	 *	   = V  - vl * w / w'
+	 *	   = V  - vl'
