+Advisor
+=======
+
+The number of candidate pages for KSM is dynamic. It can be often observed
+that during the startup of an application more candidate pages need to be
+processed. Without an advisor the ``pages_to_scan`` parameter needs to be
+sized for the maximum number of candidate pages. The scan time advisor can
+changes the ``pages_to_scan`` parameter based on demand.
+
+The advisor can be enabled, so KSM can automatically adapt to changes in the
+number of candidate pages to scan. Two advisors are implemented: none and
+scan-time. With none, no advisor is enabled. The default is none.
+
+The scan time advisor changes the ``pages_to_scan`` parameter based on the
+observed scan times. The possible values for the ``pages_to_scan`` parameter is
+limited by the ``advisor_max_cpu`` parameter. In addition there is also the
+``advisor_target_scan_time`` parameter. This parameter sets the target time to
+scan all the KSM candidate pages. The parameter ``advisor_target_scan_time``
+decides how aggressive the scan time advisor scans candidate pages. Lower
+values make the scan time advisor to scan more aggresively. This is the most
+important parameter for the configuration of the scan time advisor.
+
+The initial value and the maximum value can be changed with ``advisor_min_pages``
+and ``advisor_max_pages``. The default values are sufficient for most workloads.
+
+The ``pages_to_scan`` parameter is re-calculated after a scan has been completed.
