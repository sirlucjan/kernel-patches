Subject: [PATCH 04/19] media: uvcvideo: Allow hw clock updates with buffers
 not full

With UVC 1.5 we get as little as one clock sample per frame. Which means
that it takes 32 frames to move from the software timestamp to the
hardware timestamp method.

This results in abrupt changes in the timestamping after 32 frames (~1
second), resulting in noticeable artifacts when used for encoding.

With this patch we modify the update algorithm to work with whatever
amount of values are available.
