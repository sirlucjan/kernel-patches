Subject: [PATCH 06/12] PCI: Fix wrong length of devres array
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The array for the iomapping cookie addresses has a length of
PCI_STD_NUM_BARS. This constant, however, only describes standard BARs;
while PCI can allow for additional, special BARs.

The total number of PCI resources is described by constant
PCI_NUM_RESOURCES, which is also used in, e.g., pci_select_bars().

Thus, the devres array has so far been too small.

Change the length of the devres array to PCI_NUM_RESOURCES.
